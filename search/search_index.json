In order to construct an efficient and secured consensus protocol for Tao , we tackle the following main bottlenecks of classic blockchains: - Efficiency: Existing blockchains as employed by major cryptocurrencies(e.g., Tao 1.0 or Ethereum) do not scale well to handle a large transaction volume, e.g. Tao 1.0 and Ethereum can handle around 7-10 transactions/second. - Confirmation times: The original Tao blockchain took 7.5 minutes per block, and is significantly larger than network latency. Furthermore, a Tao 1.0 block requires 10 subsequent blocks following it so that it can be confirmed; thus it takes on average 1.5 hours for a transaction to be confirmed (with low confidence). While Ethereum uses a shorter block-time, the average confirmation time still remains relatively high, around 13 minutes Cardano . These long confirmation times hinder many important applications (especially smart contract applications). - Unwanted Fork Potential: The problem of fork chain consumes computational energy, time, and creates potential vulnerabilities for different types of attacks. - Trust While the systems are trustless, those who create them are not. As a result, existing music economy stakeholders from across the spectrum have rejected those platforms such as Ethereum for anything more than experimental use.

So you can use Web3 library to directly call the functions in the smart contract. You can follow the steps below to interact with the smart contract by using Web3 library and NodeJS. Init Web3 provider \u00b6 At the first step, you need init Web3 provider by connecting Tao Fullnode RPC endpoint. const Web3 = require ( 'web3' ) const web3 = new Web3 ( 'https://rpc.tao.network' ) const chainId = 88 For testnet/mainnet details, you can get network information here Unlock wallet \u00b6 You need to unlock the wallet before staking for the nodes Example \u00b6 // Unlock wallet by private key const account = web3 . eth . accounts . privateKeyToAccount ( pkey ) const owner = account . address web3 . eth . accounts . wallet . add ( account ) web3 . eth . defaultAccount = owner Init Web3 Tao Validator Contract \u00b6 const validatorAbi = require ( './TaoValidatorAbi.json' ) const address = '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000088' const validator = new web3 . eth . Contract ( validatorAbi , address , { gasPrice : 250000000 , gas : 2000000 }) Note: you can get TaoValidatorAbi.json here Propose/Apply a candidate \u00b6 Masternode owner need to have at least 100000 TAO to apply a fullnode to become a Masternode candidate.

Tao relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus that can support low transaction fees and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as the Random Generals Gambit and decentralized rewards for users who support the most reliable block producers via smart-contracts. Tao supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into Tao's masternode architecture (named \"Shifu\"). It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for every stakeholder in the music economy. What problem is Tao aiming to solve? \u00b6 The problems that Tao aims to solve can be summarized as follows: The network congestion (low transaction time) High transaction fees Lack of focus on music economy pain points Lack of focus on music economy data requirements Compromises which encouraged the participation of bad actors Blockchain technology hasn't been widely adopted by the music economy because of a lack of respect for the needs of artists, fans, and other stakeholders. Tao addresses these problems directly and enables many decentralized applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts, voting, supply-chain management, decentralized identity, and verification of authenticity. In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to harmonize with existing music industry stakeholders and technologies such as DAWs, rights management and accounting platforms, financial services, and payments. Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing: Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process around 7 and 15 transactions per second and the mistrust of the motives of its creators and participants has made the technology unusable for the music economy. Tao is continuously working and researching several scaling solutions. Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system, however Tao enjoys a \"second mover\" market advantage and will continue to investigate and research additional scaling methodologies. Tao supports low fee and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Tao can currently process 2'000-5'000 transactions per second (TPS). How does Tao work? What is the architecture and consensus used? \u00b6 Tao relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus that can support low fees (approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as Random Generals and staking via smart-contracts. Can you tell more about Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS)? What is it? \u00b6 At the heart of Tao, the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism enables Tao as an EVM-compatible and scalable public blockchain, on which every Ethereum smart contract can be effectively run with almost instant transaction confirmation. DPOS features its Masternode architecture in which token holders deposit 100,000 TAO to become a masternode candidate and receive votes from other token holders. The most voted masternode candidates are selected as masternodes for block creation within a period, called epoch. Each masternode takes its block creation in a round-robin manner every 2-second and follows the double validation technique for security reinforcement. A block is finalised if it is signed off by 3/4 masternodes. At the end of each epoch, the masternodes that have signed finalised blocks are rewarded. Stakers who voted for those masternodes will also be rewarded. What is the Random Generals Gambit? \u00b6 The Random Generals Gambit is a novel solution to specfic problems of proof of stake networks. As the name would suggest, the Random Generals Gambit is an additional layer of randomness which provides reliable state verification on a per-block basis. Specifically, when a block is created by a masternode, it must be verified by another randomly selected masternode and only after passing an additional verification by this random masternode is the data added to the blockchain. This solves the Byzantine Generals Problem of proof of stake by selecting a \"general\" at random from those units in the field. Derived from three years of experience with an operating proof of stake network in the wild, this unique innovation provides for an entirely new level of transaction finality and reliability in proof of stake networks. What is an 'epoch'? \u00b6 An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time starting from block #1 (900 blocks x 2s/block = around 1800s or ~30 minutes). Which scaling solutions will Tao implement? Will you have sharding? \u00b6 Tao solutions are based on on-chain scaling built into an architecture of 150 voted masternodes with our Delegated Proof-of-stake Voting (DPOS) consensus protocol. We achieve 2-second block-time and almost instant transaction confirmation. To scale further our infrastructure, we are looking very closely at sharding but will remain open to new advancements as the industry moves forward. Besides sharding, we are actively researching scalability solutions like EVM parallelization. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be evaluated before being integrated into Tao's masternode architecture. What is the current TPS? What is your targeted transaction speed and when do you think you can achieve that speed? \u00b6 Tao supports low transaction fees (approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum's) and 2-second transaction confirmation times. The mainnet with DPOS Masternodes delivers 2'000 transactions per second (TPS). What makes Tao different? \u00b6 The unique point of Tao comes from technology, the ecosystem, and the community. Tao is the only smart contract platform dedicated to serving the needs of the music economy. Novel technology: includes Delegated Proof of Stake consensus On-chain governance via smart contract Random Generals Gambit for additional consensus finality This enables Tao to achieve: Cheap transactions: approx. 1/100 of that of Ethereum 2000 TPS to handle a robust d-app and token ecosystem; TPS will be dramatically higher once our sharding solution is enabled (20k-30k TPS) 2 second block time for fast transactions EVM-compatibility allows for interoperability with Ethereum ecosystem. Our unique products TaoScan: Shows all blocks, transactions, finality, smart contracts, D-Apps and token information Shifu: Allows users to apply for a Masternode Candidate position; to vote for Masternodes and shows Masternode performance statistics TaoWallet: Securely store, send, receive TAO and other tokens issued on Tao; Allows users to vote and track rewards Waihui: A secure and efficient relayer-masternode decentralized exchange protocol Our own community of builders Tao also is working vigorously on building its ecosystem and has sealed many partnerships from all stakeholders in the music economy: from distribution, to authenticity and identity, to rights management, to payments. How does Tao compare with other available blockchain projects? \u00b6 Some of our competitors are EOS.IO, Casper FFG, Cardano, Tendermint, Lisk. The world is a pretty big place, and it is clear in the second decade of the 21st century that one blockchain will not be sufficient to serve the unique needs of every industry. Blockchain specialization is the trend which we are riding. startups often kill themselves because they cannot make a desirable product, not because of the competition but due to a lack of traction within their target industry. Tao solves this problem with a dedicated focus on the music economy. At the moment, besides the core Tao platform, we want to focus on a few quality Dapp use cases that can make a difference. Quality before quantity. Our core blockchain solution like the sharding proposal is of very high quality, and potentially better than multiple high profile attempts at scaling currently. The solution is also very unique to Tao's Marsternode design, which will remain our competitive product advantage for a long time. There are also several other product solutions in design stage which also highly integrate with Tao's overall design. These product innovations is one of the core competencies we have that make Tao very unique compared to other big projects. We are doing our best to solve the scalability problem, maximize the TPS and stay strong in our target market. Even while we focus on the music indsutry, there is still a need for decentralized finance, bonding curve funding, stablecoins, and the entire existing universe of smart-contract enabled applications, but with a music economy focus. Which blockchain(s) are Tao's main competitors? \u00b6 On the one hand, all base layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, NEM, NEO, Tao etc are competitors because app developers/token issuers will generally choose only one blockchain to work on. On the other hand, it is too early to focus on competition as it is more important to expand the whole blockchain ecosystem rather than to compete. Tao has a unique position in which it adds value to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing scalability and governance issues while keeping the same smart-contracts and general architecture while remaining laser focused on serving a specific market vertical with $26B per year in revenues. Tao is EVM-compatible. What does that mean? \u00b6 EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. Tao supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to Tao. Any d-App written in Ethereum or any other EVM-compatible blockchain framework can be seamlessly ported to Tao. Is Tao a side-chain of Ethereum? \u00b6 No. Tao has its own blockchain since the Tao 1.0 Mainnet was launched August 29th, 2016. Is Tao compatible with Ethereum? \u00b6 Yes, any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to Tao. This is one strength appealing to some dApp developers and some of our partners. Can developers make hybrid dApps using both Ethereum and Tao in one single dApp? \u00b6 Yes, they can make an app, and deploy it to both Ethereum, and Tao. It can be done relatively easy since Tao supports EVM, and share a common architecture with Ethereum. When is Tao mainnet launch? \u00b6 Tao 1.0 Mainnet was launched on August 29th, 2016. Tao is one of the oldest, consistently running, fault-free cryptocurrencies ever created. The Tao 2.0 Mainnet, which these documents address, was launched on March 29th, 2020. What is the difference between TAO and Tao? \u00b6 TAO is the native currency of the Tao blockchain platform. How do you solve 'security problems' when using Tao? \u00b6 In terms of security of consensus protocol, Tao proposes Random Generals and Randomization to protect the system. The details of these techniques can be referred in our Technical paper . Tao solves some consensus-related security aspects: Nothing-at-stake problem: This problem is commonly discussed in PoS-based blockchain consensus and just like 51% attacks in PoW. Tao solves it by using Random Generals and Randomization. The details are shown in our technical paper. Long-range attacks: Attackers can try to recreate all blocks from a very far position to the current block. Attackers can do that because PoS-based consensus does not require extra-ordinary hashing power to re-write the whole blockchain. Tao addresses by providing finality. Once a block is signed by at least 3/4 masternodes, it is consider irreversible, meaning that any attempt to re-write the blockchain history will be rejected. Censorship-resistance: Please refer to this medium article for more detailed analysis DDoS and spamming attacks: Tao's transaction fee is not zero (even it is very low), attackers still require a significant amount of TAO in order to flood the network for only a short time. How does Tao defend against spamming attacks? \u00b6 Tao has different measures to defend against spamming attacks. For instance, increasing transaction fees for smart contract creation is one of them. The min is 10 TAO. Otherwise an error of smart contract creation cost is under allowance may show up. Company \u00b6 Where is Tao registered? \u00b6 Tao isn't a company. Tao isn't a foundation. Tao is a decentralized, autonomous organization. For legal purposes it is considered an unincorporated association with global membership comprised of those who own the Tao token. Where can I take a look at Tao code? Is there a GitHub repository? \u00b6 All the code regarding Tao is free to consult on our GitHub . This includes the code for the Tao blockchain client, governance DApp, block explorer, tools, docker images, documentation, etc. However, other blockchain related projects like ReplyBlock or drafts, work-in-progress and not yet disclosed projects are usually kept in private repositories. We like to publish code publicly when it reaches a certain level of development and/or when we think auditing and contributions are beneficial to the codebase. Keeping early projects private is probably more responsible for now due to our scale. It might change in the future. We are also working with some third parties with which we signed a non-disclosure-agreements for code development. Where can I contact you to get support? \u00b6 If you need support, please contact us on one of these platforms: Technical talk and support running our softwares: Gitter (https://gitter.im/taoblockchain) Bugs or technical contributions: GitHub (https://github.com/taoblockchain/tao2) General quotes regarding our blockchain: Telegram (https://t.me/taoblockchain) Which are Tao's official channels for communication and information? \u00b6 You can keep in touch with our latest news here: Twitter: https://twitter.com/taoblockchain Telegram: https://t.me/TaoCryptocurrency Website: https://tao.network Medium: https://medium.com/taoblockchain LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/taoblockchain/ Ecosystem \u00b6 What incentives have partners and dApp developers to build on Tao? \u00b6 Tao supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to Tao. Any d-App written in Ethereum can be seamlessly ported to Tao, instantly enjoying all Tao advantages: almost zero-transaction fee; 2-second confirmation time; 2'000 TPS and soon 20K-30K TPS once sharding is enabled. D-app developers also have dedicated technical support from Tao developers. Besides the technical aspects, our partners will also benefit from the Tao community support and fundraising opportunities, thanks to Tao very good relationships with well-known investors. Why should developers build dApps on Tao? \u00b6 Developers who have projects which intend to serve the music industry can find a home with an entire community dedicated to their success. With solid roots within the music economy building on Tao will let you rise above the noise of other networks and get your project noticed by the people you want to notice it. TAO - Economics \u00b6 What is TAO? Can you describe the functions and purposes of TAO? \u00b6 TAO is the native cryptocurrency of Tao and will be the reserve cryptocurrency for all third-party apps running on Tao. Being the protocol token for the Tao infrastructure, TAO will be needed by all parties utilising Tao to build apps or issue and integrate cryptographic tokens into their apps. The supply of TAO is fixed, long-term and non-inflationary. In addition to the above, TAO is an integral part of the Tao network for a number of reasons. TAO will be used to fund the development of Tao and its ecosystem (TaoScan, Shifu, TaoWallet, etc.). TAO will be used as a reward to incentivise the building of the Tao engine/ecosystem. TAO will be used as a long-term, decentralized governance instrument of the Tao network. You can check our technical whitepaper for more details. Can I mine TAO? \u00b6 TAO is not mineable but mintable by masternodes. Masternodes are responsible for creating, verifying and finalizing the blocks created within a period, called epoch. Masternodes and Stakers will receive block rewards. What is TAO circulating supply and total supply? \u00b6 The initial circulating supply at the Tao 1.0 genesis block was 33,000,000. Since launch, the network has generated roughly another 1,000,000 tokens via consensus. Another 21,000,000 tokens were minted with the migration to Tao 2.0 and sold on the open market to raise intial funds, bringing the circulating total to 55,000,000, however the current circulating supply is increasing every epoch. After 8 years, TAO total supply is fixed at 100,000,000 TAO. How is TAO distributed? \u00b6 The token allocation is splitted as follows: 55 millions TAO in circulation post-migration; 12 millions TAO are reserved for the team; 16 millions TAO are reserved for strategic partners and an ecosystem building fund; 17 millions TAO are reserved as block rewards for the next 8 years How are block rewards distributed? \u00b6 17 millions TAO are reserved as block rewards for the next 8 years. 1st and 2nd year: 4 million TAO annually 3rd, 4th and 5th year: 2 million TAO annually 6th, 7th and 8th year: 1 million TAO annually Will Tao have inflation? \u00b6 The total supply is fixed at 100 million TAO in the first 8 years (non-inflationary). 17 million TAO which are reserved as block rewards will have been all distributed after 8 years. At that time, we are expecting that block rewards will come from the exchange fees. But the Board of Governors shall evaluate the economic situation at the time block rewards expire and may decide to increase the total supply by 0.5-1 million TAO per year (which will be used as block rewards) (~small inflation, 0.5%-1% annually). How often are block rewards paid out? \u00b6 Block rewards will be earnt every epoch, which lasts for 900 of two-second-block time (~30 minutes). Those users which have delegates assigned to masternodes which have produced blocks will be also rewarded. If Tao has zero fees, how can Masternodes get rewards? \u00b6 The block rewards will be emitted from a reserved fund with 17 million TAO for the first 8 years. The block rewards are as follows: 1st and 2nd year: 4 million TAO annually 3rd, 4th and 5th year: 2 million TAO annually 6th, 7th and 8th year: 1 million TAO annually We plan to have a built-in DEX, the revenues from the DEX will go to the Masternodes as well. After 8 years, the block rewards will come from the exchange fees. Also, the Board of Governors can decide to increase the total supply by 0.5-1 million TAO per year (which will be used as block rewards). What is the price of the additional tokens? \u00b6 The price is set by free market value, which at the time of this writting was ~$0.025 When will TAO be listed on new exchanges? \u00b6 We do not discuss about exchange related questions due to the regulation. We will announce every exchange news on our official channels on due time. Tao is currently traded on Alt.Market and QTrade.io Is TAO an ERC-20 token? \u00b6 No. Since Mainnet, TAO has become the native coin of the Tao blockchain. What is a TRC1 token? \u00b6 A TRC1 token is a token which can be issued on the Tao blockchain. TRC1 is similar to the ERC-20 standard in the Ethereum blockchain. Where to store TAO? How can I send TAO to my wallet? \u00b6 You can store TAO in TaoWallet, TrustWallet, MetaMask, and soon Ledger and Trezor. We recommend to store TAO in TaoWallet. Please, read more details here: https://docs.tao.network/get-started/wallet/ How to connect Metamask / MyEtherWallet with Tao mainnet? \u00b6 The followings are information used for configuring Metamask to connect to Tao Mainnet. RPC endpoint: https://rpc.tao.network Chain ID: 88 Symbol: TAO Network Name: Tao Mainnet Tao is now supported by MyEtherWallet. All you need to do is to choose Network TAO in the supported network list in MyEtherWallet. You can find the info about our Mainnet or Testnet on our Networks page. Also, you can find out more detailed information about how to use different wallet types to connect to Tao Mainnet on Connect your wallet Where can I buy TAO? (exchanges)\" \u00b6 You can trade TAO on various exchanges. Take a look in the \"Exchanges\" section on this page of our main website. Masternodes \u00b6 Does Tao have Masternodes? How do they work? \u00b6 Yes, Tao has a maximum of 150 Masternodes with Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus for low transaction fee, and instant transaction confirmation. Masternodes create, verify and validate new blocks in Tao\u2019s platform. Masternode Candidates: Any account can deposit 50,000 TAO using Shifu to become a masternode candidate. A candidate can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days (1'296'000 blocks) after the resignation. Becoming a Masternode: A candidate becomes a masternode when he/she belongs to the top 150 most voted candidates in each epoch. A Masternode can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days after the resignation. Rewards: The rewards a masternode receives in each epoch is proportional to the number of signatures it signs. Masternodes will also receive fees from the Tao DEX, which is planned for development in Q1 2019. Tao masternodes started signing blocks and receiving block rewards with the Mainnet release in December 14th, 2018. What is a masternode in the Tao ecosystem? \u00b6 A Tao masternode is a server which uses its computing power to contribute to the network. Its job is to create and sign blocks. For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in the form of TAO. Masternodes are elected using the DPOS consensus via our governance dApp Shifu What are the incentives to run a masternode? \u00b6 Masternodes contribute to the network and for this work they will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which will likely exceed the cost for running the infrastructure. However, masternode owners need to invest in Tao by depositing at least 50'000 TAO, and stake them in the long term. After the initial deposit, if the account does not become a masternode (has less votes than the top 150 most voted candidates), he will not receive rewards. Therefore, candidates are incentivised to do as much as they can to signal their capability to support Tao to get into top 150 most voted candidates. How did you decide on 150 masternodes? Why did you decide to increase this from the initial 99? \u00b6 The reason came from both decentralization consideration, and also scalability consideration. In terms of decentralization, 150 is better than 99. The more important consideration is the scalability. We also increased the number of masternodes to better suit the sharding solution later. Also 150 is Dunbar\u2019s Number . Where will the Masternode rewards come from? Will they be from the DEX? \u00b6 The block rewards will come from a 17 million TAO reserve for the next 8 years - this was decided since the genesis block. Our Economics paper lays out the number in detail. And then later on, because we plan to have a built-in DEX, the revenues from the DEX will go to the Masternodes as well. When are Masternode rewards paid out? \u00b6 Masternode operators and stakers will receive rewards every epoch. An epoch is a 900-block period of 2-second block time (~30 minutes). How can I check my rewards? \u00b6 You can check your masternode/staking rewards using TaoWallet. Alternatively you can use Shifu or TaoScan. How much rewards will Masternodes receive? \u00b6 Each epoch consists of 900 blocks, which will reward a total of 250 TAO in the first two years. This amount of 250 TAO will be divided to all of the Masternodes proportionally to the number of signatures they sign during the epoch. Example: With only 25 Masternodes and equal performances, every masternode would be rewarded with 10 TAO. With 125 Masternodes, each one would receive 2 TAO per epoch. Please, refer to our Economics paper for more details about the masternodes reward. How much reward from Masternodes will go to the Masternode infrastructure (node owner) and how much is for voters? \u00b6 There is a reward sharing ratio among token holders and masternode who has been elected supported by the token holders. The reward achieved by each Masternode will be divided into three portions: Infrastructure Reward: The first portion of 40% called Infrastructure Reward goes to the Masternode operator. Staking Reward: The second portion of 50% called Staking Reward goes to the pool of all voters for that Masternode which is shared proportionally based on the token stake. The Masternode also gets proportional rewards for his 50K TAO initial deposit. Foundation Reward: The last portion of 10% called Foundation Reward goes to a special account controlled by the Masternode Foundation, which is run by the Tao company initially. What is the expected ROI for Masternodes and Stakers? \u00b6 The rewards for every masternode will be dynamic and depending on multiple factors like: number of masternodes in the network, the efficiency signing blocks, the total number of votes on each masternode. The most efficient masternodes signing blocks will receive higher rewards. Please, refer to our Economics paper for more details about the masternodes reward. We discuss 3 possible scenarios with 50, 100 and 150 Masternodes; and different number of total votes. One example is outlined below. Scenario: 150 Masternodes, 12.5 million tokens voting (a total of 20 million token locked). Reward achieved per epoch (900 blocks): By a Masternode = 0.6667 Tao By a Voter with 1K Tao staked = 0.00625 Tao Approximate reward achieved per week: By a Masternode = 224 Tao By a Voter with 1K Tao staked = 2.1 Tao Approximate reward achieved per year: By a Masternode = 11,680 Tao By a Voter with 1K Tao staked = 109.5 Tao (10.95% annually) By a Voter with 50K Tao staked = 5,475 Tao Total reward for a Masternode with a 50K Tao deposit: 11,680 + 5,475 = 17,155 Tao (34.31% annually) Masternode Candidate \u00b6 What is a masternode candidate? What is the difference between masternode candidate and masternode? \u00b6 A Masternode Candidate is any node who deposited 50K TAO and is listed on Shifu . One Candidate only becomes a Masternode when he is in the top-150 most-voted masternode candidates in an epoch. Only these elected masternodes will be able to sign blocks and receive block rewards. How can I become a Masternode? \u00b6 The first step to become a masternode, is becoming a masternode candidate. To become a Masternode Candidate you need: to run Tao software in a machine with certain minimal hardware requirements to deposit 50\u2019000 TAO in a smart-contract via Shifu The list of Masternode Candidates will be available on the governance DApp, Shifu . The next step is to be elected as one of the top 150 most voted candidates. Do I need to use my own computer to run a node? \u00b6 We recommend using an IaaS (\"cloud\") provider of your choice (like Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud GCE, Vultr, etc). The machine must be directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) and with 100% uptime. If you have other production grade environment than cloud provider at your disposal, please tell us more about on our Gitter . Which are the hardware requirements to run a node? \u00b6 Processing transactions is mostly CPU bound. Therefore we recommend running CPU optimized servers. Directly facing internet (public IP, no NAT) 16 cores CPU 32GB of RAM SSD storage We recommend using popular cloud providers as their reliability and uptime are close to 100%. Those servers would be a good starting point: DigitalOcean: CPU optimized droplet 32GB/16CPU Amazon EC2: C5 instance Google Cloud Engine: n1-highcpu-16 Setting up a masternode candidate on a weaker machine might result in poor performances, significantly impacting owner's rewards and the chain performance. Note: If you are running a node in Testnet, 2CPU/8GB of RAM is sufficient. How do Masternode Candidates become Masternodes? \u00b6 Once you are a Masternode Candidate, you need the support of Tao community in the form of votes. The top 150 most voted candidates every period called epoch (900 blocks of 2-second block-time) will be promoted to Masternode. This list will change dynamically every epoch. Only the 150 masternodes elected will be able to sign blocks and will receive rewards in the form of TAO. Is there any guide on 'How to run a masternode from A to Z'? \u00b6 See this Medium post . Where can I find the latest masternode guide or the instructions for setting up a masternode? \u00b6 Find more details about tmn here: https://docs.tao.network/masternode/tmn/ What is the command to start a fullnode with 'tmn'? \u00b6 tmn start --name node_name --net mainnet --pkey your_private_key tmn is installed but just not in your path.\" \u00b6 See: https://docs.tao.network/masternode/tmn/#tmn-command-not-found I tried stopping the node using 'tmn stop', but after that I ran 'tmn status' it still says running.\" \u00b6 You can run tmn --debug stop and send the log to us. We will help you to investigate the issue. Do I need two wallets to run a Masternode? \u00b6 It is recommended for security reasons. You can create your wallet from wherever you want, the only rule being that you need two of them. One for your masternode, and one to make the 50K deposit (this account will receive the rewards). What is the 'coinbase address'? \u00b6 'Coinbase address' is the public address used to run your node and register it to the system. We recommend using two addresses when running your nodes. The public address or 'coinbase address' will only receive transaction fees. The private address is from where you make the initial 50K TAO deposit and where the block rewards will be collected. How can I create a public 'coinbase address' wallet? Is it only with TaoWallet for iOS and Android? Are there other options? \u00b6 You need to create a wallet for the masternode public address. This wallet does not need to contain any TAO, think of it as a shell address. You will then stake tao into the masternode address via your main TAO wallet. You can use the iOS and Android apps. Also you can create wallets with Metamask, MyEtherWallet. You can also use https://wallet.testnet.tao.network to create an empty wallet, then use it as coinbase address. I noticed that we need another wallet for masternode with a different mnemonic. Assume we use a hardware wallet, we would need another hardware wallet with different mnemonic? \u00b6 It is recommended to use a separate empty account for your masternode as it only receive transactions fees - what we call public or 'coinbase address' on the documentation. The block rewards are sent to the account connected to Shifu who make the initial deposit - the 'private' address. Can I use the same address pair (tmn public address + initial deposit address) for all my nodes? Or I have to transfer tokens to another wallet and start the second node? \u00b6 No. Must use different public 'coinbase' addresses. But you can use the same initial deposit ('private') address, then all rewards will be transferred to only one address. I have finished all steps of setting up node. Why I don't see my node on Shifu? \u00b6 You must apply to become a masternode candidate. Do I need to deposit the 50K TAO before or after running 'tmn' in VPS? \u00b6 After. Your node must be fully synched before applying. How do I check the blockchain sync status from the node? \u00b6 You can watch the logs, but it is easier from the TaoStats website or its eth.blockNumber API call. If the masternode owner deposits 60K TAO instead of 50K on its own node, can it later on unstake the excess 10K? \u00b6 Yes, it can. How can I change my node's name? \u00b6 You can do it on Shifu. Go to your masternode page on Shifu, if you are logged in Shifu with the owner account, you can click next to the masternode name to edit infos. My node status is 'Proposed', will it change status with next checkpoint? \u00b6 Yes, if you are in top-150 most voted. Why is a node flagged as 'Slashed'? \u00b6 With Slashing v2.0, a masternode who doesn't create any block within an epoch and therefore delays the network by 10 seconds at each of their turns will be penalized (no rewards) for the next five epochs. Note: a slashed Masternode can still sign transactions if he\u2019s online but receive no rewards for doing so. After being slashed for 5 epochs, the Masternode is analysed for re-entry. If the slashed Masternode have signed any transaction during the last epoch (meaning that he's up and working again) it will come back to its Masternode status and receive rewards normally. Otherwise it will be slashed for a new round of 5 epochs. This can happen as long as the node isn't back up or kicked out of the top 150. Some reasons for being Slashed might be that the masternode does not have the correct Tao software, lack of memory or masternode crashes due to the lack of e-maintenance and operation by the masternode owner. How do I update my Masternode to the newest version? \u00b6 Run this command: pip3 install -U tmn && tmn update && tmn start How many nodes I am allowed to run? \u00b6 As many as you can. How can I resign as Masternode? \u00b6 If you no longer want to be a masternode, you can resign on Shifu. Your masternode will stop generating rewards and your funds will be locked for 30 days (1 296 000 blocks). After the lockup period you will be able to withdraw your 50'000 TAO deposit. Can I close the node entirely, then start a new one with a totally separate coinbase address without being penalized? \u00b6 No. Your old node will be penalized (50K initial deposit 30-day lockup) and your new node has to apply again. Is it possible to move a masternode later, like backup and start it from another IP address? \u00b6 Yes. What if I do not have enough TAO for a masternode? Can I stake my coins? \u00b6 Yes. Token holders can stake TAO and receive rewards. To stake TAO you need to vote for masternode candidates by sending TAO to each candidates specific voting-address using the official governance d-App: Shifu.` The top-150 most voted candidates will become masternodes. Token holders can also un-vote candidates, but the tokens will be locked for the next 96 epochs / 8,640 blocks (approx. 48 hours) after the un-voting. Masternode token deposits, and all tokens used to vote for masternodes will enter the staking program, and earn block rewards in each epoch, plus any fees. Tokens used to vote for candidates who do not become masternodes will not earn staking rewards. Voter \u00b6 What are the voters incentives? Do voters get rewards too? \u00b6 Token voters should vote for the candidates who demonstrate strong support to the Tao ecosystem. If strong candidates are voted to become masternodes, the network will be more powerful and the voters will earn more rewards. More information on the voting and reward mechanism in the Economics paper . Can you stake TAO? \u00b6 Yes, you can stake TAO and receive more TAO coins as reward. How do I Stake? Just holding on my wallet? \u00b6 To stake in Tao you must participate in the Tao Masternode election, voting for masternode candidate(s) using Shifu to deposit your tokens in a voting smart-contract. Login to Shifu and click 'Vote' on a node. How does Tao Masternode Proof-of-Stake-Voting (DPOS) work? \u00b6 Everyone can can find a list of all masternode candidates on Shifu . All token holders can vote TAO on any candidates via Shifu. To vote, token holders must deposit TAO in a smart-contract associated with the voted candidate. The top-150 most-voted candidates will be promoted to masternode during the next epoch and will be able to sign blocks and collect rewards. All the voters (stakers) who supported the elected masternodes will receive rewards, proportional to the amount of TAO voted and the efficiency of the masternode. How do I vote (stake)? \u00b6 Any token holder can vote. Login to Shifu and then click 'Vote' on a node. Then enter the amount of TAO you want to vote (minimum is 100 TAO). You vote by depositing (staking) tokens to a smart-contract associated with a masternode candidate. There are many ways to vote in Shifu: Voting from TaoWallet. Voting from Ledger wallet Voting from Trezor wallet Voting via MetaMask (can be connected to your hardware wallets). Voting from TrustWallet Voting with your wallet's Private Key or MNEMONIC. How do I vote/stake from TaoWallet app on my phone? \u00b6 Please, read the following guide . Or watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXp4WHl_sxY How do I vote from my Ledger Nano S? \u00b6 Plug in your Ledger and open the Ethereum App. Go to Shifu. Login in the top-right corner and select Ledger from the drop-down menu. Change the HD path to m/44'/60'/0' You should see your TAO balance. To see a list of nodes click on the Shifu homepage button - top left corner. Next to each node should be a 'Vote' button. When voting you will need to confirm transaction on your Ledger. Can I stake for multiple masternodes via Ledger? \u00b6 Yes, you can. Ledger not working? \u00b6 Probably your Ledger firmware version is incompatible. Sometimes you should upgrade your Ledger to the newest firmware. Occasionally a new version could be problematic and you should try to use the previous firmware version. Can I use Trezor to vote for masternodes? \u00b6 Yes. Shifu supports Trezor now. What criteria must be considered when voting? Which masternode candidate should I vote for? \u00b6 The most important criteria to maximize voter\u2019s profit, the main points you should consider when voting, are the following: Top-150 most voted: Your candidate must be one of the top-150 most-voted. If your candidate gets in the 151th most-voted place, it will not be promoted to masternode and you will earn zero rewards. Hardware, Performance: Powerful CPU, RAM, bandwidth, latency, etc so the node can work hard and receive high rewards Number of signed blocks: The more signed blocks per epoch, the higher rewards Time of last signed block: Verify that the masternode is active Total Capacity: Staking rewards are shared between all the masternode votes. Less voted masternodes are more profitable. 5K staked on a 50K-staked masternode will receive ten times more rewards than 5K staked on a 500K total staked masternode. Social Proof, Reputation: Masternodes managed by trusted companies that are for the long term, maintaining the masternode, updating hardware and software to last versions, fixing problems, etc. How many Masternode Candidates can I vote for? \u00b6 You can vote for as many candidates as you wish, splitting your TAO. Example: If you have 1'000 TAO you can vote 500 TAO for candidate A, 450 TAO for candidate B, and 50 TAO for candidate C. What is the minimum amount to Stake? \u00b6 The minimum amount to stake is 100 TAO. Which hardware-wallet can I use to vote? \u00b6 You are able to use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) with MyEtherWallet or Metamask. You can also directly connect to the Tao Mainnet with Ledger/Trezor and vote on Shifu . Is it possible to re-invest the TAO earned and use it to continue voting? \u00b6 Yes. Is there a way to stake the earned rewards automatically? \u00b6 This is not supported currently. What happens if the Masternode I voted for stops working? Will I get my TAO back? \u00b6 Yes. You can unvote that masternode and take your tokens back after 96 epochs (approx. 48 hours) lock-up period. How do I UnVote? \u00b6 If you do not want to support a masternode you voted for, you can unvote it by clicking the \u2018Unvote\u2019 button on the masternode's page and enter the amount of TAO you wish to unvote. After unvoting, your TAO are still locked in the smart contract for 96 epochs (approx. 48 hours) before you are able to withdraw. When the lockup period is finished you need to click the \u2018Withdraw\u2019 button and the coins will appear again on your wallet. How to withdraw after unvoting? \u00b6 After unvoting, you need to wait until your TAO is unlocked from the smart contract (96 epochs, approx. 48 hours). Then you can go to Shifu and click the 'Withdraw' button in your account page (the three vertical dots on the top-right) and choose which withdrawal you want to receive back your TAO. Note that you might see multiple withdrawals on your account page if you made multiple unvotes previously. Products \u00b6 TaoScan \u00b6 What is TaoScan? \u00b6 TaoScan is our block explorer. It is pretty similar to EtherScan if you are already familiar with it. TaoScan provides a user friendly, details and perfection-oriented user interface for Tao block explorer. From a user perspective, TaoScan brings Tao\u2019s transparency to users, because all block, transaction, finality, smart contracts, dApp and token information are read from Tao and shown to users. Furthermore, TaoScan also offers technical visualisations and does useful statistics about the Tao performance, token holders and other functionalities. What is a TxHash? How to check a TxHash? \u00b6 TxHash stands for 'transaction hash', and is also known as a transaction ID. An example of what a TxHash looks like: 0x838d33119b33e4519cb201e49bfc570ddc0fbdc6d9cf7038d8254a4de97f7112 To check a TxHash, follow the steps below: On TaoScan , go to the search bar with the magnifying glass icon. Paste your transaction hash (TxHash) in the search bar and click the icon or press ENTER. Your transaction details will show up. Example: https://scan.testnet.tao.network/txs/0x838d33119b33e4519cb201e49bfc570ddc0fbdc6d9cf7038d8254a4de97f7112 TaoStats \u00b6 What is TaoStats? \u00b6 TaoStats shows the various metrics regarding the current mainnet including the current number of masternodes, masternodes performance, current TPS, block-time, confirmation time, finality and other useful metrics. How much is the average time to see my node appear on TaoStats? \u00b6 It should be less than a minute after tmn command is executed and finished. Stats page wasn't working and showed a 70-second block. What happened? \u00b6 The stats page is javascript code running in your browser. If your computer loses internet connection or the page is not active anymore for some reasons, the time will increase forever. In this case just refresh the page. Shifu \u00b6 What is Shifu? \u00b6 Shifu , the 'Governance dApp', provides a professional UI that allows to see the list of masternodes and candidates, to deposit 50k TAO to become a masternode candidate, to vote for masternodes, and to show masternode performance statistics. How do I login on Shifu? \u00b6 Go to Shifu. On the top-right corner click 'Login'. Then select how do you want to login: with TaoWallet, with Ledger, with Trezor, with Metamask, TrustWallet or Private Key/Mnemonic. What is the 'capacity' of a Candidate/Masternode? \u00b6 The capacity of a candidate is the 50K TAO initial deposit plus the total amount of TAO voted for that candidate. Which of these numbers on Shifu will tell us which is a good performing node vs poorly performing? \u00b6 On Shifu, click on a candidate to open the candidate page. Scroll down to 'Masternode Rewards'. You should look at 'Sign number', 'Slashing history' under Masternode Rewards to determine a good node or not. Masternodes will sign a maximum of 60 blocks per epoch. A good masternode will create around 60 sign transactions in that epoch. We also calculate the reward based on sign transactions number. What is a 'checkpoint'? \u00b6 For each iteration of 900 blocks (called epoch), a checkpoint block is created, which implements only reward works. The masternode, who takes turn in the circular and sequential order to create blocks, has to scan all of the created blocks in the epoch and count number of signatures. It is worth noting that token holders who unvote before the checkpoint block will not receive any shared reward in the Staking Reward portion. I want to stop running my node.\" \u00b6 If you don't want to run your masternode anymore, please remember to resign before shutting down the node. TaoWallet \u00b6 What is TaoWallet? Where can I download it? \u00b6 Tao Wallet is the official mobile wallet for Tao, aiming to store the TAO native coin and tokens issued on Tao. Tao Wallet also allows users to vote for masternodes and track rewards. Users can download TaoWallet at App Store and Play Store . What tokens/coins does TaoWallet support? \u00b6 The current TaoWallet supports native TAO on Tao Mainnet. TaoWallet will support all tokens on Tao platform in the future. How can I create a TAO wallet? What are the options to create a TAO wallet? \u00b6 You can create a TAO wallet with the iOS app, the Android app, MyEtherWallet or Metamask. Can we vote on Shifu using TaoWallet? \u00b6 Yes, TaoWallet can be used for voting/staking on Shifu. How to Restore/Import Recovery Phrase into TaoWallet? \u00b6 Open TaoWallet, click 'Import Your Wallet', then type your recovery phrase. How to Restore/Import Private Key into TaoWallet? \u00b6 Open TaoWallet, click 'Import Your Wallet', then type your private key. I have Private Key in my PC. How do I import into TaoWallet in a safe way? \u00b6 Go to TaoWallet, click 'Import Your Wallet', choose 'private key' option, you can import directly or using QR code. How do I backup my wallet? \u00b6 Go to TaoWallet, click 'Setting tab' in the top left corner, press 'backup wallet', then write down/ scan QR code of your private key/ backup phrase. How do I protect my TaoWallet app? \u00b6 TaoWallet allows you to prevent unauthorized transactions by putting a password on the app itself. With this feature, you must authenticate every time you launch/ make a transaction on the TaoWallet. You can enable password protection in Settings. TIP: Make sure to upgrade your TaoWallet to the latest version to see this feature. How do I protect my funds from scammers? \u00b6 Every wallet consists of two parts - public key and private key. TaoWallet stores your private key directly on your device. There are a couple of formats TaoWallet can display your private key in: Private key - an unencrypted collection of numbers and letters that unlocks access to your address on various blockchains Mnemonic phrase - 12 words used to secure your private key. Much easier to remember. No service should ever ask you for your private key. Anyone with your private key can access your wallet and have FULL CONTROL of your funds. I lost my backup, what do I do? \u00b6 You can always have multiple copies of your backup, if you think you can store it safely. Any valid backup (private key/ mnemonic) will get you to the most current state of your wallet. We at TaoWallet, don\u2019t have access to your wallet or your private key. We are not able to help you recover your backup if you lose your device and your backup. Please make sure you store your backup(s) in a safe place. Can I access cold storage wallet in 'view-only' mode with TaoWallet? \u00b6 The TrustWallet watch functionality allows users of cold storage wallets - Trezor, The TaoWallet watch functionality allows users of cold storage wallets: Ledger, KeepKey, or any other device - to access their wallet in a view-only mode. By ONLY importing a PUBLIC KEY, we ensure that no action can be performed inside the wallet, meaning no asset can be transferred out of the wallet or accessed in any way. That allows users to see how their crypto portfolio is performing while having their keys in a safe place. Here is how you can do it with TaoWallet: Open the TaoWallet Choose 'import a wallet' Select 'import your public key' -> Paste your address -> Import I sent my TAO to a wrong address. What do I do? \u00b6 TAO: m/44'/889'/0'/0 Can I switch from my existing wallet app like Metamask, MyEtherWallet, etc.? \u00b6 You can export private key/recovery phrases from existing wallet app then import to TaoWallet. Waihui \u00b6 What is the difference between Waihui and a DeX? \u00b6 Tao's philosophy on decentralized exchanges is quite different from others. In Tao's design for decentralized exchanges, Waihui is the core decentralized exchange protocol, which takes in charge the order matching and execution. Waihui is integrated into the core layer of the Tao consensus. A decentralized exchange (DEX) in Tao's design for DEXs is a relayer that interacts with the underlying Waihui protocol. Typically, a relayer will send/receive trade orders to/from Waihui which processes these trade orders. TaoDEX will be the first relayer in Tao's decentralized exchange ecosystem. We expect TaoDex to be one of the most sophisticated Dex out there, consequently users who like the Dex experience will use TaoDex. TaoDex will be the first to list any token running on top of Tao together with well-known cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH, and have the best liquidity for new Tao's tokens. With Tao almost zero-fee, 2-second confirmation and 2'000 transactions per second, all relayers interacting with Waihui Protocol will be fully decentralized and very efficient. What is a Relayer? How can I set up one? \u00b6 A decentralized exchange (DEX) in Tao's design for DEXs is a relayer that interacts with the underlying Waihui protocol. Typically, a relayer will send/receive trade orders to/from Waihui which processes these trade orders.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"general/faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"general/faq/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"general/faq/#tao","text":"","title":"Tao"},{"location":"general/faq/#what-is-tao","text":"Tao is an novel solution to the data sharing, integration, and monetization problems of the music economy by implementing a custom smart contract protocol designed specifically for the music industry, by the music industry.

Tao addresses these problems directly and enables many decentralized applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts, voting, supply-chain management, decentralized identity, and verification of authenticity. In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to harmonize with existing music industry stakeholders and technologies such as DAWs, rights management and accounting platforms, financial services, and payments. Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing: Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process around 7 and 15 transactions per second and the mistrust of the motives of its creators and participants has made the technology unusable for the music economy. Tao is continuously working and researching several scaling solutions. Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system, however Tao enjoys a \"second mover\" market advantage and will continue to investigate and research additional scaling methodologies.

DPOS features its Masternode architecture in which token holders deposit 100,000 TAO to become a masternode candidate and receive votes from other token holders. The most voted masternode candidates are selected as masternodes for block creation within a period, called epoch. Each masternode takes its block creation in a round-robin manner every 2-second and follows the double validation technique for security reinforcement. A block is finalised if it is signed off by 3/4 masternodes. At the end of each epoch, the masternodes that have signed finalised blocks are rewarded.

In Tao's design for decentralized exchanges, Waihui is the core decentralized exchange protocol, which takes in charge the order matching and execution. Waihui is integrated into the core layer of the Tao consensus. A decentralized exchange (DEX) in Tao's design for DEXs is a relayer that interacts with the underlying Waihui protocol. Typically, a relayer will send/receive trade orders to/from Waihui which processes these trade orders. TaoDEX will be the first relayer in Tao's decentralized exchange ecosystem. We expect TaoDex to be one of the most sophisticated Dex out there, consequently users who like the Dex experience will use TaoDex. TaoDex will be the first to list any token running on top of Tao together with well-known cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH, and have the best liquidity for new Tao's tokens. With Tao almost zero-fee, 2-second confirmation and 2'000 transactions per second, all relayers interacting with Waihui Protocol will be fully decentralized and very efficient.","title":"What is the difference between Waihui and a DeX?"},{"location":"general/faq/#what-is-a-relayer-how-can-i-set-up-one","text":"A decentralized exchange (DEX) in Tao's design for DEXs is a relayer that interacts with the underlying Waihui protocol.

General hardware notice \u00b6 The Tao team has extensively tested performances and come up with those minimal requirements for any Tao masternode host. Testnet Must be facing internet directly (no NAT, public IP) Must have at least 2 cores Must have at least 8GB of RAM Must use an IaaS (\"cloud\") provider of your choice (AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud, etc.). Storage must be SSD Mainnet Must be facing internet directly (no NAT, public IP) Must have at least 16 cores Must have at least 32GB of RAM Must use an IaaS (\"cloud\") provider of your choice (AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud, etc.) Storage must be SSD We recommand prioritizing CPU. For example with Digital Ocean, pick a CPU optimized droplet. On AWS EC2, an C5 type instance would be a perfect match. The full node will serve on port 30303 udp and tcp for p2p communication with other nodes, 8545 tcp for RPC api and 8546 tcp for websocket api. You may need to edit your firewall configuration accordingly. If you have other production grade environment than cloud provider at your displosal, please tell us more about on our Gitter . tmn \u00b6 We made a simple command line interface called tmn to easily and quickly start a Tao full node. It takes care of starting the necessary docker containers with the proper settings for you. It will really suit you if you don't already have a big infrastructure running. Spin up a machine in your favorite cloud and get your full node running in a few minutes! Prerequisites \u00b6 To use tmn, you should meet these requirements in addition to the hardware ones: Docker CE Python >= 3.5 Installation \u00b6 Simply install it from pip. pip3 install --user tmn Update \u00b6 Update it from pip. pip3 install -U tmn First start \u00b6 When you first start your full node with tmn, you need to give some informations. --name : The name of your full node. It should be formatted as a slug string. Slug format authorize all letters and numbers, dashes (\"-\") and underscores (\"_\"). You can name it to reflect your identity, company name, etc. --net : The network your full node will connect to. You can choose here to connect it to the Tao Testnet or Mainnet (once launched). --pkey : The private key of the account that your full node will use. A Tao full node uses an account to be uniquely identified and to receive transaction fee. Important note: we advise for security measures to use a fresh new account for your masternode. This is not the account who will receive the rewards. The rewards are sent to the account who will make the 50k TAO initial deposit. It could look like this: tmn start --name [YOUR_NODE_NAME] \\ --net testnet \\ --pkey [YOUR_COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY] Once started, you should see your node on the testnet stats page or the mainnet stats page , depending on which net you are connecting to! Note: it can take up to one hour or more (depending on the blockchain data size) to properly sync the entire blockchain. Usage \u00b6 You can now interact with it via the other commands: stop : Stop your full node. start : Start your full node if it is stopped. status : The current status of your full node. inspect : Display the details related to your full node. Useful for applying your full node as a masternode. remove : Completely remove your masternode, unique identity and data. Troubleshooting \u00b6 tmn: command not found \u00b6 It might happen that your PATH is not set by default to include the default user binary directory.

Get some TAO \u00b6 Info Testnet TAO are only used for experimenting with the testnet. They have no value in the main blockchain and not market value. Using TaoWallet \u00b6 TaoWallet provides a function named Earn TAO to test . It allows you to get 15 TAO on the Testnet. Just click on it and you will see your balance go up. Note You can use this function only once. You then have to use the faucet for any extra Testnet TAO needed. Using any wallets \u00b6 We also have a service called \"Faucet\" which allows you to get 15 TAO at a time. Access the faucet site at: faucet.testnet.tao.network Enter your wallet address in the field and tick the I'm not a robot box. Click REQUEST 15 TAO and Wait for some seconds for the transaction to be confirmed. You will receive a success confirmation message and the amount of TAO in your wallet should be updated. You can check your TAO balance by either looking at your wallet or using TaoScan . How To Vote \u00b6 Now you have some TAO. You can access our governance dApp, Shifu , to start voting for masternodes. Shifu natively supports Metamask. You can also access your account page (the vertical three dots on the top right) to fill in your wallet Private Key or MNEMONIC (see image below). If you use Metamask, you need to connect Mettamask to our testnet (please see the \"Create a wallet\" section) and choose Metamask in the drop-down settings list. Once configured, you can vote for masternodes by clicking on the Vote button. At least 100 TAO is required per vote. After clicking submit, your TAO will be sent to the voting smart contract and locked there. Reward \u00b6 Every epoch (~30 minutes), you will automatically receive rewards for each masternode you voted for. How to Unvote \u00b6 If you do not want to support a masternode you voted for, you can unvote it by clicking the Unvote button on the masternode's page and enter the amount of TAO you want to unvote. After unvoting, your TAO is still locked in the smart contract for 48 hours before you are able to withdraw. How to Withdraw \u00b6 For withdrawals after unvoting, you need to wait until your TAO is unlocked from the smart contract. Then you can click the withdraw button in your account page (the vertical three dots on the top right) and choose which withdrawal you want to receive back your TAO. Note that you might see multiple withdrawals on your account page if you made multiple unvotes previously.

Masternodes will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which likely exceeds the cost for running the infrastructure. However, masternode candidates need to invest in Tao by depositing at least 50'000 Tao, and stake them for a long term. Furthermore, after the initial deposit to become a candidate, if he doesn't make it to the top 150 most voted candidates, he will not be promoted as masternode and thus receive no rewards. Therefore, candidates have an incentive to do as much as they can such as signalling their capability to support Tao to get into top 150 most voted candidates. Requirements \u00b6 To have a masternode candidate, the following requirements must be satisfied: The token holder has an up and running node -- see our documentation . The token holder must hold a minimum required amount of tokens (50 000 TAO). These 50 000 TAO are deposited to the Voting Smart Contract. Must be one of the 150 most voted masternode candidates in the system. The voting by token holders is credited through a Voting DApp that allows token holders to send TAO through the smart contract mechanism. Applying to become a masternode \u00b6 You can apply by going on Shifu . Connect the wallet that contains the funds you want to deposit. Warning The wallet who makes the initial deposit will be the one receiving block rewards. On the top right corner, click on \"Become a Candidate\". Enter the amount of TAO you want to deposit (minimum 50'000). Enter your coinbase address. This is the address of the account that your masternode is using. If your are running your node with tmn , you can simply run tmn inspect to get it. Important note: We advise for security measures to use a fresh new account for your masternode or 'coinbase address'. This is not the account that will receive the rewards. The rewards are sent to the account that will make the 50k TAO initial deposit. Confirm with apply and proceed to make the payment. Your full node will now be listed on Shifu. People can view its details and vote for it. A candidate becomes a masternode when it belongs to top 150 most voted candidates in each epoch. Info An epoch is a period of 900 blocks (~ 30 minutes) starting from block #1 If your node is in the top 150 most voted candidates at the checkpoint between two epochs, it will be promoted as a masternode and will start producing blocks at the next epoch. Resigning your masternode \u00b6 In case you want to stop your node, you need to resign it from the governance first in order to retrieve your locked funds. Access Shifu, go to your candidate detail page, and click the Resign button. Your funds will be available to withdraw 30 days after the resignation (1,296,000 blocks).

Note: You will MISS many tips and tricks found in the detailed instructions. Beginner/Intermediate users, keep reading... \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 What is a masternode? \u00b6 A masternode is a computer on a decentralized blockchain network that is running 24 hours a day that keeps the system operating. It powers the blockchain network by processing transactions and signing blocks. What are the benefits of a masternode? \u00b6 Masternodes help support the network by creating and signing blocks, providing faster transaction times, and decentralized operations. They utilize PoS (Proof of Stake) vs PoW (Proof of Work) consensus-building. Masternode operators are paid a reward (coins) as an incentive for their involved investment of coin-deposit, server setup, and continued operation. What is a VPS? \u00b6 VPS stands for Virtual Private Server. They are paid servers hosted on a cloud-hosting-provider. Each VPS runs an independent installation of an operating system (OS), Linux or Windows, and typically provides root access to the OS for advanced management and control. Why is a VPS highly recommended for masternodes? \u00b6 A VPS is recommended (and often required) for masternode setups, as you will need a dedicated static IP and 99.9% uptime to provide a stable and efficient node for the network. Unlike your home or office PC, a masternode VPS serves one purpose, to securely and efficiently run a masternode. A VPS is online 24/7 and provides dedicated resources for the project\u2019s decentralized network. 1. Choose your hosting provider \u00b6 Choose which VPS hosting provider you want to utilize. The following providers are sample VPS providers. You could choose elsewhere, or even your own 24/7 server. AWS (Amazon) DigitalOcean GCE (Google) Linode OVH Vultr Note on provider choice: It is encouraged for masternode operators to utilize various hosting providers so as to encourage a more decentralized network. It is in your best interest because if any one popular provider goes down, others will get more rewards. 2. Start your VPS server \u00b6 Start/Boot your VPS server instance. Choose Ubuntu 18.04 . This is an LTS version ( Long Term Support ). LTS versions are more stable and have seen less errors when installing Docker and Python. You must use Ubuntu 18.04 to seek support from the wider community or Tao. If you need help with this, see this example . Data Storage: It is recommended to assure that your provider has Block Storage or expandable disk space on SSD drives (more performant). Block Storage is pay-as-you-go disk space that you can expand in the future. You may not need it now, but you will in the future. Some locations within a hosting provider do not have this, while others will. SSH-Key login: Consider utilizing a SSH-Key login over passwords. Some providers allow you to set it up upon server creation. 3. Change passwords and accounts (logged in as root user) \u00b6 Login to your newly created server with SSH / Putty. If you need help with this, see this example . ssh root@178.62.127.177 Note on Users: Login as the root user at first. Later, we will create and switch to your own username. If you did not utilize SSH-key login (highly recommended), you will want to change the root password (only the first time) with the following command. passwd Save your root password as you can get locked out of your own server if you forget it. It is strongly recommended to use a 16+ char password with a mix of letters, numbers, special characters. You are now logged in as root. The root user is the administrative user in a Linux environment that has very broad privileges. Because of the heightened privileges of the root account, you are discouraged from using it on a regular basis. This is because part of the power inherent with the root account is the ability to make very destructive changes, even by accident. The next step is to set up an alternative user account with a reduced scope of influence for day-to-day work. Create a new user \u00b6 Use the following command to add a new user account that we will use to log in to from now on. Our user is called michael, you can replace it with any username that you like. Use the same username as your local mac/PC username and you will have an easier time logging in! adduser michael You will be asked a few questions, starting with the account password. Enter a strong password. Optionally, fill in any of the additional information if you want or ignore it. This is not required and you can just hit ENTER in any field you wish to skip. Grant the user administrative privileges \u00b6 Now we have a new user account with regular account privileges. However, we will need to do administrative tasks from this normal account. To add these privileges to our new user, we need to add the new user to the sudo group. This will allow our normal user to run commands with administrative privileges by putting the word sudo before each command. As root, run this command to add your new user to the sudo group (substitute michael with your new user): usermod -aG sudo michael -a stands for Append and -G is Group; sudo is the groupname you are adding to your user You can check to make sure that the usermod command worked: cat /etc/group | grep sudo groups michael Assure that you get a response such as sudo:x:27:michael from first command and michael : michael sudo from the second command. When you eventually (not yet) log in as your new user, you can type sudo before commands to perform actions with superuser privileges. Remain logged in as the root user for now, as we have more initial setup to do. After this, you will almost always login as your new user. 4. Configure your VPS (remain logged in as root user) \u00b6 We will now prepare the prerequisites for taomn . You need Python 3.6+ and Docker installed. Upgrade operating system \u00b6 We should upgrade the Ubuntu operating system and all installed package libraries first. You may consider doing this upgrade occasionally in the future. Type these two commands on the console with an ENTER after each: apt update apt upgrade Watch out for WARNINGs or ERRORs. A lot of text could fly by, and you should watch all of it in case something installs incorrectly. Google anything out of the ordinary and try to understand or fix it. Reboot your VPS instace in case any of the upgraded components will only fully engage until rebooted fresh. reboot Install Python \u00b6 apt install python3 apt install python3-pip Check if you have installed the right Python version (must be newer than version 3.6). python3 --version System Security \u00b6 This topic is optional, but highly recommended. If the default SSH port is not changed, you could see nefarious connection-attempts in a short time-period. Look at our wiki security doc for more details At a minimum, you will want to consider: SSHD on non-standard port UFW (Uncomplicated Fire Wall) (open port 30303 tcp & udp, and above non-standard SSH) Other security options you could consider: SSH key-based login (vs password) Fail2ban Blocking remote password auth Blocking remote root SSH-access 5. Setup Docker (logged in as new user) \u00b6 From now on, you will almost always want to login as your new user . If you are logged in as root still, logout and log back in as the new user. You may want to consider denying remote root ssh logins. ssh michael@178.62.127.177 Install Docker Repositories \u00b6 Update the apt package index. Then install various packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS. The third line adds Docker\u2019s official GPG key. sudo apt update sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - \"OK\" is normal output of that last command; -fsS shows less progress, but still error messages and -L allows redirect NOTE: Be careful with certain ssh consoles. They may not paste the \u2018|\u2019 symbol correctly. Next, verify that you have the correct key, by searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint. Compare the results to what is below. apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88 Example Results (format may be slightly different, but the string of char-numbers the same): pub rsa4096 2017-02-22 [SCEA] 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88 uid [ unknown] Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com> sub rsa4096 2017-02-22 [S] Use the following command to set up the \"stable\" repository. You could get errors here if you have a release of Ubuntu that is too recent (non LSB). sudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $( lsb_release -cs ) stable\" Install Docker CE \u00b6 Update the apt package index. Then install the latest version of Docker CE: sudo apt update sudo apt install docker-ce Watch out for WARNINGs or ERRORs. Google anything out of the ordinary and try to understand or fix it. Once installed, add your current user to the Docker group and verify that the user has been added. sudo usermod -aG docker michael groups michael cat /etc/group | grep docker Assure Docker is working \u00b6 Verify that Docker CE is installed correctly by running the hello-world image. This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits. The second command shows more detailed docker information. docker run hello-world sudo systemctl status docker # hit 'q' to exit Docker CE is installed and running. Congratulations! You have installed Python and Docker. You have the prerequisites ready to run Tao\u2019s taomn. TROUBLESHOOTING error: could not access the docker daemon If you have installed Docker, and get this error, you probably forgot to add your user to the docker group. Please run this, close your session and open it again. usermod -aG docker $(whoami) 6. Installing TAOMN utility \u00b6 taomn is a simple interface created by Tao developers to help you quickstart your masternode . It is installed as a python package and it utilizes two docker containers once operating. We will follow through the steps found here: guide to install taomn \u201cWe made a simple command line interface called taomn to easily and quickly start a Tao masternode. It takes care of starting the necessary docker containers with the proper settings for you. It will really suit you if you don\u2019t already have a big infrastructure running. Spin up a machine in your favorite cloud and get your masternode running in a few minutes!\u201d Install and update the Tao-created taomn utility from pip: pip3 install --user taomn pip3 install -U taomn Watch out for WARNINGs or ERRORs and troubleshoot (see end of this section). To check that taomn has been correctly installed, use the following command to show some taomn info: pip3 show taomn Name: taomn Version: 0 .5 Summary: Quickstart your masternode Home-page: https://tao.network Author: Etienne Napoleone Author-email: info@tao.network License: GPL-3.0+ Location: /home/michael/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages Requires: python-slugify, click, clint, pastel, docker The next step will be to actually START TAOMN , however we cannot do this until we have two wallet addresses. See the next section for this. TROUBLESHOOTING Occasionally a VPS image will not come installed with all of the software packages needed to install what we need. If you get any of the errors below, you are in need of particular packages to be installed. ERROR: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \u2018setuptools\u2019 SOLUTION: sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools ERROR: Failed building wheel for <package> SOLUTION: pip3 install wheel ERROR: error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1 SOLUTION: sudo apt install build-essential ERROR: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory SOLUTION: sudo apt install python3-dev 7. Create Wallet Addresses \u00b6 Before being able to proceed further, you will need two seperate Tao wallet addresses to operate a masternode. One helps to operate the masternode day-to-day, and the other is where the 50,000 TAO (50k) is staked from. The genius of this is that the wallet where the 50k will pass through (and where rewards will eventually come into) is never stored or seen by the VPS server. This is a security strategy that keeps your coins safe. WALLET1 - Operating Wallet: Used for operating the masternode, including signing blocks. It effectively acts as a unique identifier of your masternode. No coins need to be inserted in this wallet; It's even advised to be empty, so in case of breach, no funds are exposed. WALLET2 - Deposit Wallet: Your 50k of staked coins need to be placed here; later, the 50k will go into a smart contract; eventually, masternode rewards will show here. You will need both the Public Key and Private Key for both addresses. It is advise that you store all of this information somewhere safe, yet accessible. You may need to utilize this information during continued operations of your masternode. Password manager apps like KeePass/KeePassXC, LastPass, or 1Password are your friend. Your private key is your money. Give it to no one. WALLET1 Suggestions - If setting up a single masternode, you can use a mobile wallet. Binances Trust Wallet and Taos Tao Wallet apps are best. Alternatives are Metamask and MEW (MyEtherWallet), in that order. You can use Ledger Hardware Wallet, however the added security on WALLET1 isn't as necessary. WALLET2 Suggestions - Preferred to use Ledger / Hardware Wallet (if possible) in combo with Metamask because 50k and rewards will be handled here. Assure to use an address you do not have history on eth chain with - otherwise others will be able to see your unrelated investment history. Because most wallet apps do not have Tao mainnet as a selectable network yet, you will need to manually add the new mainnet if you have not already. See the first link below for the guide on how to do this. How to Set Up a Wallet: Setting Up MyEtherWallet, Metamask, or Binance TrustWallet More info: Using Metamask or Mobile Tao Wallet Links to mobile downloads and other tao info Old Masternode guide (testnet) Section on wallets 8. Run TAOMN \u00b6 Below, you will finally start your Tao node with a utility called taomn . Initial TAOMN start \u00b6 IMPORTANT: Logout and SSH back in so that the $PATH variable takes effect. This allows you to run taomn from any directory. exit ssh michael@178.62.127.177 When you first start your full node with taomn start , you need to give some information. --name: The name of your full node. Your input will be converted to a \"slugified\" name. Slug format allows all letters and numbers, dashes (\"-\") and underscores (\"_\"). Ex: MyMaStErNode#99 cool -> mymasternode99-cool . You can name it to reflect your identity, company name, etc. --net: The network your full node will connect to. You can choose here to connect it to the Tao mainnet or testnet . --pkey: The private key of your WALLET1 wallet (non 100k). A Tao full node uses a wallet address to be uniquely identified and to receive transaction fees. Transaction fees are not rewards, and they are usually tiny. Important note: we advise for security measures to use a fresh new wallet for your masternode. This is not the wallet that will receive the rewards. The rewards are sent to the wallet that will make the 100k TAO initial deposit. The command is structured like this: taomn start --name [ YOUR_NODE_NAME ] --net mainnet --pkey [ YOUR_WALLET1_PRIVATE_KEY ] We used the following command for our node (copy your own name & private key ): taomn start --name Atlantis --net mainnet --pkey cf03cb58************ TROUBLESHOOTING taomn: command not found It might happen that your PATH is not set by default to include the default user binary directory. You can add it by adding it to your shell $PATH: On GNU/Linux: echo \"export PATH= $PATH : $HOME /.local/bin\" >> $HOME /.bashrc source $HOME /.bashrc 9.

Jumpstart the chaindata (Optional) \u00b6 Full Jumpstart instructions can be found here The basic structure has been created, blocks have started synchronizing, and now we want to speed up the process by pulling in the latest chaindata. Chaindata is where the entire history of tao's blockchain records are stored. All coin transactions, all smart contracts, all operations. This takes up a lot of space. To syncrhonize it from decentralized nodes piecemeal-like could take days or weeks. Instead, lets download the latest image of the data, and synchronize from there. 11.

Installing TAOMN utility"},{"location":"masternode/masternode-setup-guide/#7-create-wallet-addresses","text":"Before being able to proceed further, you will need two seperate Tao wallet addresses to operate a masternode. One helps to operate the masternode day-to-day, and the other is where the 50,000 TAO (50k) is staked from. The genius of this is that the wallet where the 50k will pass through (and where rewards will eventually come into) is never stored or seen by the VPS server. This is a security strategy that keeps your coins safe. WALLET1 - Operating Wallet: Used for operating the masternode, including signing blocks. It effectively acts as a unique identifier of your masternode. No coins need to be inserted in this wallet; It's even advised to be empty, so in case of breach, no funds are exposed. WALLET2 - Deposit Wallet: Your 50k of staked coins need to be placed here; later, the 50k will go into a smart contract; eventually, masternode rewards will show here. You will need both the Public Key and Private Key for both addresses. It is advise that you store all of this information somewhere safe, yet accessible. You may need to utilize this information during continued operations of your masternode. Password manager apps like KeePass/KeePassXC, LastPass, or 1Password are your friend. Your private key is your money. Give it to no one. WALLET1 Suggestions - If setting up a single masternode, you can use a mobile wallet. Binances Trust Wallet and Taos Tao Wallet apps are best. Alternatives are Metamask and MEW (MyEtherWallet), in that order. You can use Ledger Hardware Wallet, however the added security on WALLET1 isn't as necessary. WALLET2 Suggestions - Preferred to use Ledger / Hardware Wallet (if possible) in combo with Metamask because 50k and rewards will be handled here. Assure to use an address you do not have history on eth chain with - otherwise others will be able to see your unrelated investment history. Because most wallet apps do not have Tao mainnet as a selectable network yet, you will need to manually add the new mainnet if you have not already. See the first link below for the guide on how to do this.

It takes care of starting the necessary docker containers with the proper settings for you. It will really suit you if you don't already have a big infrastructure running. Spin up a machine in your favorite cloud and get your masternode running in a few minutes! Prerequisites \u00b6 Python >= 3.6 Docker CE Warning We recommand to run your masternode on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. This version have python 3.6 and has been reported as working out of the box. Installation of Python \u00b6 To install Python under debian based distribution, run the following commands. apt update apt install python3-pip To check if you have installed the right Python version (must be greater than 3.5). python3 --version Installation of Docker CE \u00b6 To install Docker, first update the apt package index. sudo apt update Then Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS. sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common Add Docker\u2019s official GPG key. curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - Verify that you now have the key with the fingerprint 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88 , by searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint. apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88 Set up the stable Docker repository. sudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" Update the apt package index. Then install the latest version of Docker CE. sudo apt update sudo apt install docker-ce Once installed, add your current user to the Docker group. usermod -aG docker $your_user_name Warning You need to relog into your account for this to take effect. Verify that Docker CE is installed correctly by running the hello-world image: docker run hello-world This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits. tmn \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 Simply install it from pip. pip3 install --user tmn Update \u00b6 Update it from pip. pip3 install -U tmn First start \u00b6 When you first start your full node with tmn, you need to give some information. --name : The name of your full node. It should be formatted as a slug string. Slug format authorize all letters and numbers, dashes (\"-\") and underscores (\"_\"). You can name it to reflect your identity, company name, etc. --net : The network your full node will connect to. You can choose here to connect it to the Tao Testnet or Mainnet (once launched). --pkey : The private key of the account that your full node will use. A Tao full node uses an account to be uniquely identified and to receive transaction fee. Important note: We advise for security measures to use a fresh new account for your masternode. This is not the account who will receive the rewards. The rewards are sent to the account who will make the 50k TAO initial deposit. --api : Expose RPC and websocket on ports 8545 and 8546 . Important note: Those ports should not be accessible directly from the internet. Please setup firewalling accordingly if you need to access them localy. Use a reverse proxy if you want to expose them to the outside. It could look like this: tmn start --name [YOUR_NODE_NAME] --net testnet --pkey [YOUR_COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY] --api Once started, you should see your node on the stats page ! Note: it can take up to one hour to properly sync the entire blockchain. Usage \u00b6 You can now interact with it via the other commands: stop : Stop your full node. start : Start your full node if it is stopped. status : The current status of your full node. inspect : Display the details related to your full node. Useful for applying your full node as a masternode. remove : Completely remove your masternode, unique identity and data. Troubleshooting \u00b6 tmn: command not found \u00b6 It might happen that your PATH is not set by default to include the default user binary directory. You can add it by adding it to your shell $PATH: On GNU/Linux: echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin' >> $HOME/.bashrc On MacOS: Replace [VERSION] by your version of python (3.5, 3.6, 3.7) echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Library/Python/[VERSION]/bin' >> $HOME/.bashrc Then reload your environment: source ~/.bashrc error: could not access the docker daemon \u00b6 If you have installed Docker, you probably forgot to add your user to the docker group. Please run this, close your session and open it again. usermod -aG docker $your_user_name pip3 install fails due to not being able to build some package \u00b6 Your OS might not come with build tools preinstalled.

Please check all the criteria carefully before clicking on the \u201cIssue token\u201d and wait for the contract to be deployed. Note: Any developer with some experience of developing and deploying smart contracts can refer to our reference implementation of the TRC2 standard to make customizations to the deployed token contract.

The deposit can\u2019t be withdrawn, that amount is deducted to pay masternodes for transaction processing. Congratulations! You have already applied your TRC2 token to TaoZ protocol. Now you can edit the transaction fee (transaction fee in your token). You can change this number during the operation of your token. In the token management dashboard, you will have some buttons to interact with the tokens such as transfer, deposit more TAO to pay for subsequent transaction fees. Don\u2019t forget to check your TRC2 fee fund because transactions will not be processed if the remaining deposit is not enough to pay transaction fees. Donate transaction fee \u00b6 If the TAO funds of the token issuer in TaoIssuer is not enough to pay for subsequent transaction fees, any token holders can deposit more TAO to the TaoIssuer contract to continue making transactions. Go to donate transaction fee tab from TaoIssuer\u2019s homepage. Enter the name of token you want to donate fee then input the donation amount. Considering that transaction fee in Tao is near-zero, 1 TAO can power thousands of transactions. Transfer token \u00b6 You can transfer your TRC2 token to any member in your community just by going to \u201ctransfers token\u201d.

We are working to create an alternative, scalable financial system which is more secure, transparent, efficient, inclusive and equitable for everyone. Tao is an innovative solution to the scalability problem with the Tao 1.0 blockchain. Tao relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus that can support near-zero fee, and 2-second transaction confirmation time. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and \"true\" randomization processes. Tao supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into Tao's Masternode architecture which will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for stakeholders in the music economy of any size. Scope \u00b6 This document describes Tao\u2019s initial draft for the Tao blockchain\u2019s economics system. Masternodes \u00b6 Masternodes are full-nodes that create, verify and validate new blocks in Tao\u2019s platform. Masternode Candidate : Any account can deposit 50K TAO using the official on-chain governance d-app to become a Masternode Candidate. 50K TAO deposit can earn staking rewards. A Candidate can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days (1,296,000 blocks) after the resignation. Becoming a Masternode : A Candidate becomes a Masternode when the user belongs to top 150 most voted Candidates in each epoch. A Masternode can resign, but the tokens will be locked for the next 30 days after the resignation. Reward : The reward a Masternode receives in each epoch is proportional to the number of signatures he/she signs. Token Voting and Staking \u00b6 Token voting : Token holders can vote for Masternode Candidates by sending TAO to each Candidate specific voting address using the official governance d-app. Top 150 most voted Candidates will become Masternodes. Token holders can un-vote a Candidate, but the tokens will be locked for the next 48 hours (86,400 blocks) after the un-voting. Staking : Masternode token deposits, and all tokens used to vote for Masternodes will enter staking program, and earn block rewards in each epoch, plus any fees. Tokens used to vote for Candidates who do not become Masternodes will not earn staking reward. Token Emission Schedule \u00b6 Following the fundraising commitment : The total amount of tokens at the genesis block is 55 million TAO tokens in circulation; 12 millions are reserved for the team vested over the next 4 years; 16 millions are reserved for strategic partners, and an ecosystem building fund which totals 83 millions tokens. Plus, 17 millions are reserved as block rewards for the next 8 years, the amount of tokens in circulation at the end of the 8th year after the genesis block is around 100 million TAO. After the mainnet: the block reward for the first and second year is 4 million TAO annually; the block reward for the 3rd, 4th, 5th year is 2 millions TAO annually ; and the block reward for the 6th, 7th and 8th year is 1 million TAO annually . Subsequently, the block reward will be halted, or activated at a number less than or equal to 1 million TAO annually. Implementation : Each epoch consists of 900 blocks, which will reward a total of 250 TAO in the first two years. 250 TAO will be divided to all the Masternodes proportional to the number of signatures they sign during the epoch. Afterward, the reward achieved by each Masternode will be divided into three portions. The first portion of 40% called \u201cInfrastructure Reward\u201d goes to the Masternode. The second portion of 50% called \u201cStaking Reward\u201d goes to the pool of all voters for that Masternode which is shared proportionally based on the token stake. The last portion of 10% called \u201cFoundation Reward\u201d goes to a special account controlled by the Masternode Foundation, which is run by Tao company initially. Voting/Staking Consideration \u00b6 Candidate/Masternode incentives \u00b6 Masternodes will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which likely exceeds the cost for running the infrastructure. However, Masternodes need to invest in Tao by depositing at least 50K Tao, and stake them for a long term. Furthermore, after depositing 50K TAO to become a Candidate, if the account cannot become a Masternode (has less votes than Top 150 most voted Candidates), he/she will receive no rewards. Therefore, Candidates have an incentive to do as much as they can such as signaling their capability to support Tao to get into top 150 most voted Candidates. Token voter incentives \u00b6 Token voters should vote for Candidates who signal a strong support for Tao because if the Candidate does not become a Masternode, voters will not receive any rewards. However, token voters should also vote for the less voted Candidates because the most voted Candidates will receive less reward per token stake comparatively. Long Term Platform Economics Consideration \u00b6 P/E theory of token value \u00b6 Equity price can often be a multiple of annual earnings a company generates. In the case of a blockchain platform, earnings could be considered as the total rewards and fees that the platform produces. The multiples for technology startups in the early days could exceed 200 which is where Ethereum network is approximately at the moment. Quantity theory of money for token value \u00b6 In this theory, the total amount of TAO can be considered the money supply for the blockchain economy including all the d-apps and tokens on top of Tao. Assuming a constant price, and velocity of money, demand for money will raise proportionally to the total amount of activities of the whole blockchain network, which will raise the price of TAO if the supply of Tao is fixed, or the inflation rate is very small. Tao\u2019s advantages of minimal transaction fee, and very fast confirmation time could spur a massive amount of activities for Tao tokens, and other tokens on top of Tao. Store of value theory of token value \u00b6 Blockchain native tokens can be considered as the means of fundraising, or the store of value within their own blockchain economy if the supply of the token is fixed, or the inflation rate is very small, and predictable. These conditions are applying to Ether and Bitcoin at the moment, and can be applying to TAO token in the future as the Tao\u2019s economy grows. Built-in decentralized exchange \u00b6 Tao roadmap includes a built-in decentralized exchange, in which a portion of fees will be added to the pool of epoch rewards. These fees could be substantial if there are many valuable tokens on top of Tao. This extra feature can increase the future earnings of the network, and raise TAO price based on the P/E theory. Decentralized Governance \u00b6 Become a Masternode \u00b6 Becoming a Masternode is an important signal of long-term support for Tao platform. We would welcome other entities to become a Masternode, to show their supports by helping the network, and gradually decentralize the platform governance. Board of Governors \u00b6 It is postulated that Tao platform would later be coordinated by non-profit body such as Board of Governors (or Foundation) amongst many other decentralized bodies which receive a steady amount of income from the network, and act solely in the interest of the network. Technical decision making \u00b6 The technical decisions should be considered, debated, and decided upon by qualified experts based on the long-term interest of the network. Economic decision making \u00b6 The economic decisions such as the amount of block rewards, inflation rate, the division of block rewards might be based on the consensus of majority of the Masternodes (with their voters). Board of Governors could be one of the coordinating bodies for these activities using the official governance d-app. Appendix A: History of the Project \u00b6 Tao PTE. LTD. raised funds to build Tao blockchain platform in early 2018. The ICO whitepaper is at https://goo.gl/avtnZ1. The terms of sale and other documents can be found at https://tao.network/exchanges Tao platform will be gradually decentralized in 2-8 years after the mainnet launch, and eventually become a secure public blockchain platform for everyone. Appendix B: Reward Calculation Formula and Details \u00b6 General notations \u00b6 N: the current number of masternodes, maximum of N = 1..150 M_1 , M_2 , .., M_N : the set of masternodes in the current epoch C_1 , C_2 , .., C_N : the number of signatures a masternode has made S_1 , S_2 , .., S_N : the total amount of staked (including deposited and voted) TAO for a masternode D_1 , D_2 , .., D_N : the amount of deposited TAO by a masternode X: the total reward per epoch for all masternodes Total reward per masternode = Infrastructure reward + staking reward MN: stand for masternode Reward divided to Masternode M_i : R_i = \\frac{C_i*X}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}C_i} Reward per epoch: Masternode infrastructure reward: 0.4 R_i Voter with 1k voted TAO: \\frac{0.5R_i*1000}{S_i} Masternode staking reward: \\frac{0.5R_i*D_i}{S_i} Reward per week (48 * 7 = 336 epochs): Masternode infrastructure reward: 336 * 0.4 R_i Voter with 1k voted TAO: 336 * \\frac{0.5R_i*1000}{S_i} Masternode staking reward: 336 * \\frac{0.5R_i*D_i}{S_i} Reward per year (48 * 365 = 17520 epochs): Masternode infrastructure: 17520 * 0.4 R_i Voter with 1k voted TAO: 17520 * \\frac{0.5R_i*1000}{S_i} Masternode staking reward: 17520 * \\frac{0.5R_i*D_i}{S_i} Total reward for a masternode: 17520 * 0.4 R_i + 17520 * \\frac{0.5R_i*D_i}{S_i} Applying the reward calculation formula to specific scenarios \u00b6 Note that, for simplification of illustration: The total amount of staked TAO for all masternodes is equal The signatures for all masternodes in the scenarios are equal With these assumptions, all masternodes receive the same divided reward (R) and the same infrastructure reward. Furthermore, the reward for Voters with 1k voted TAO is equal regardless of which the amount is voted for. Scenario 1: 50 Masternodes, 2.5 million token voting, a total of 5 million token locked. \u00b6 N = 50, X = 250, S_1 = S_2 = .. = S_{50} = 5 000 000 / 50 = 100k TAO C_1 = C_2 = .. = C_{50} Therefore, R_1 = R_2 = .. = R_{50} = R = X/50 = 5 TAO Reward per epoch: \u00b6 MN infrastructure reward = 0.4 * 5 = 2 TAO For Voter with 1k voted = (0.5 * 5 * 1000) / 100k = 0.025 TAO MN staking reward with 50k TAO deposited: 50 * 0.025 = 1.25 TAO Reward per week: \u00b6 MN infrastructure reward = 336 * 2 = 672 TAO For Voter with 1k voted = 336 * 0.025 = 8.4 TAO MN staking reward with D = 50k TAO deposited: 336 * 1.25 = 420 TAO Reward per year: \u00b6 MN infrastructure reward = 17520 * 2 = 35 040 TAO For Voter with 1k voted = 17520 * 0.025 = 438 TAO MN staking reward with 50k deposited: 17520 * 1.25 = 21900 TAO Total reward per MN with D = 50k deposited: 35 040 + 21 900 = 56940 TAO Scenario 2: 100 Masternodes, 3 million token voting, a total of 8 million token locked. \u00b6 N = 100, X = 250, S_1 = S_2 = .. = S_{100} = 8 000 000 / 100 = 80k TAO C_1 = C_2 = .. = C_{100} Therefore, R_1 = R_2 = .. = R_{100} = R = X/100 = 2.5 TAO Reward per epoch: \u00b6 MN infrastructure reward = 0.4 * 2.5 = 1 TAO For Voter with 1k voted = (0.5 * 2.5 * 1000) / 80k = 0.015625 MN staking reward with D = 50k deposited: 50 * 0.015625 = 0.78125 TAO Reward per week: \u00b6 MN infrastructure reward = 336 * 1 = 336 TAO For Voter with 1k voted = 336 * 0.015625 = 5.25 TAO MN staking reward with D = 50k deposited: 336 * 0.78125 = 262.5 TAO Reward per year: \u00b6 MN infrastructure reward = 17520 * 1 = 17 520 TAO For Voter with 1k voted = 17520 * 0.015625 = 273.75 TAO MN staking reward with D = 50k deposited: 175 20 * 0.78125 = 13687.5 TAO Total reward per MN with D = 50k deposited: 17 520 + 13 687.5 = 31208 TAO Scenario 3: 150 Masternodes, 12.5 million token voting, a total of 20 million token locked. \u00b6 N = 150, X = 250, S_1 = S_2 = .. = S_{150} = 20 000 000 / 150 = 133 333 TAO C_1 = C_2 = .. = C_{150} Therefore, R_1 = R_2 = .. = R_{150} = R = X/150 = 1.6667 TAO Reward per epoch: \u00b6 MN infrastructure reward = 0.4 * 1.6667 = 0.6667 TAO For Voter with 1k voted = (0.5 * 1.6667 * 1000) / 133 333 = 0.00625 TAO MN staking reward with 50k deposited: 50 * 0.00625 = 0.3125 TAO Reward per week: \u00b6 MN infrastructure reward = 336 * 0.6667 = 224 TAO For Voter with 1k voted = 336 * 0.00625 = 2.1 TAO MN staking reward with D = 50k deposited: 336 * 0.3125 = 105 TAO Reward per year: \u00b6 MN infrastructure reward = 17520 * 0.6667 = 11 680 TAO For Voter with 1k voted = 17520 * 0.00625 = 109.5 TAO MN staking reward with D = 50k deposited: 175 20 * 0.3125 = 5475 TAO Total reward per MN with D = 50k deposited: 11 680 + 5475 = 17155 TAO","title":"Economics paper"},{"location":"wp-and-research/economics-paper/#tao-designed-for-the-music-economy","text":"","title":"TAO - Designed for the Music Economy"},{"location":"wp-and-research/economics-paper/#preface","text":"","title":"Preface"},{"location":"wp-and-research/economics-paper/#taos-vision-and-mission","text":"Our mission is to be a leading force in building the Internet of Value, and its infrastructure and applying it specifically towards addressing the pain points of the music economy.

The majority of public blockchain technology/platforms have a built-in cryptocurrency in which every transaction shows the amount of tokens or native coins that the sender is transferring to the recipient. In this regard, blockchain provides transparency to all users, which is not always expected by the majority of businesses. A business would like to hide the transaction amount, instead of showing it to everyone. This paper presents TaoP - a protocol proposed by Tao for private transactions on the Tao public blockchain. The paper describes a protocol that allows creating anonymous transactions that hide the transaction value, sender, and receiver to preserve the financial privacy of holders of TAO and tokens on Tao. TaoP is the first ever EVM-compatible private transaction protocol with very fast transaction speed that allows anonymizing the transaction sender in a transaction without requiring an intermediary. TaoP solves the following problems: Performance: Most (if not all) current privacy coins , i.e. Monero, ZCoin, ZCash, are slow because of high block time in the consensus protocol of those public chains. TaoP operates as a DApp on Tao, which provides transaction confirmation within 2-4 seconds. Transaction sender anonymity: most EVM smart contract-based private transactions require a relayer to sign a private transaction to pay the transaction gas that will eventually be refunded. This makes the privacy transaction system semi-decentralized. TaoP, on the other hand, uses TaoZ - the protocol to make gasless transactions without requiring a relayer between the transaction creator and the blockchain. Out-of-gas: Verifying cryptographic proofs in private transactions requires intensive computation, which could cause the out-of-gas problem in EVM environment. To reduce gas consumption and speed up transaction proof verification, TaoP implements a set of precompiled contracts integrated in the core EVM of Tao. TaoP allows creating a private token standard to make super fast token-based payment systems and DApps on Tao. TaoP relies on the following techniques: Cryptographic privacy building blocks include: Stealth address: This technique is used for obfuscating transaction recipients by generating a new one-time public key for every transaction recipient so that there is no way for a third party to find the relationships between 2 different transaction recipients. What this means is that, if Alice is sending 2 transactions to Bob , no one, except Alice and Bob could find out the fact that Bob is the recipient in both transactions. Ring Signature and Ring Confidential Transaction (RingCT): These are techniques used by Monero for obfuscating transaction senders and transaction amounts in a transaction. Bulletproofs: Zero-knowledge proofs that allow proving an encrypted number is within a range without revealing the number itself. Bulletproofs are used in TaoP transactions to prove that a transaction amount in a private transaction is positive in order to prevent double spending. TaoZ: TaoZ is the first decentralized gasless transaction protocol on Tao. TaoP relies on TaoZ to create a transaction fee vault for private transactions. This fee vault is stored in TaoIssuer contract on Tao to pay the network fee while the actual private transaction fee is paid internally in the private transaction. Precompiled contracts: A set of precompiled contracts for Ring Signature verification and Bulletproof range proof is integrated directly into the core EVM of Tao. This allows any smart contract (i.e. private token contract) to call those precompiled contracts to verify cryptographic proofs. Why privacy matters? \u00b6 Privacy is necessary for ensuring freedom on the internet. When your transactions are being watched \u2014 or when your transaction history is available to be known \u2014 a person isn't free to make their own decisions. With other digital currencies, bad actors are able to match people to their balances and details about parties involved, amounts and trends. Background \u00b6 Blockchain technology fundamentally relies on distributed system principles and cryptography techniques, especially digital signature algorithms. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is widely used in most blockchain systems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tao to generate a signature in order to authenticate the sender of a transaction. The most widely used elliptic curve in blockchains is secp256k1. The 64-character string called private key is the most important information that any holder should keep private. A private key can be used for generating a public key, which is in turn used for deriving an Ethereum user address (40 hex characters) that every cryptocurrency holder is familiar with. Mathematically, an address X can be generated from a private key P as follows: Pk = P*G X = bytes20(SHA256(Pk)) Where Pk denotes the public key derived from the private key, SHA256 is the cryptographic hash, bytes20 takes the first 20 bytes of any data, and G is a common generator point in secp256k1 curve. Eventually, X is a 40-character string (20 bytes) derived from the private key. The multiplication P*G is called elliptic multiplication. It is easy to compute a public key from a private key but it is infeasible to compute a private key from a given public key (there is no division in the elliptic curve number space). Pederson commitment \u00b6 Pederson commitment is a cryptographic commitment scheme equivalent to secretly writing a secret message m in a sealed, tamper-evident, individually numbered (or/and countersigned) envelope kept by who wrote the message. The envelope's content can't be changed by any means, and the message does not leak any information. In TaoP, a Pederson commitment C to a number f is defined as follows: C = m*G + f*H Where m is 256-bit number called blinding factor/mask, and H is another generator point. If we consider f as an account\u2019s balance on Tao, the commitment C can be used for hiding the transaction amount of such account. In other words, C is the Pederson encrypted amount of such account. Pederson commitment is a form of additively homomorphic encryption, which has the following nice property: The sum of two Pederson commitments to f1 and f2 is equal to the Pederson commitment of f1 + f2. `C(m1, f1) + C(m2, f2) = C(m1 + m2, f1 + f2)` This is the key application of Pederson commitment to most privacy-focused blockchains. TaoP architecture \u00b6 TaoP supports both an anonymous TAO transfer method and a private token standard on Tao. The following figure shows the overview of TaoP that is integrated both at the core and the smart contract layer of Tao. Figure 1: Overview of TaoP Instead of directly sending funds to the recipient, the sender will anonymize their TAO by making a transaction to the Privacy smart contract. As long as send transactions are made to the privacy contract, the latter allows TAO holders to send/receiver TAO to/from others without showing the transaction amount within it. TaoP transactions are like Monero transactions but in a smart contract on the very fast blockchain Tao. Typically, funds flow as follows: A user anonymize her TAO by making a deposit transaction to send TAO to the privacy smart contract. This transaction is a normal transaction and does not hide the transaction amount. This transaction creates a Note in the privacy contract. A note is similar to the concept of Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) on Bitcoin blockchain with additional information, i.e. a Pedersen commitment, that is used for creating cryptographic proofs when the user wants to make an anonymous send transaction. The user makes anonymous send transactions from the user to a recipient. The transaction amount is hidden. Funds are not moved out of the privacy contract. The user uses her own private key to create RingCT and Bulletproofs for the privacy contract to verify. Anonymous send obfuscates transaction sender and receiver, and hides transaction amounts. The user can decide to de-anonymize her private TAO by withdrawing all or part of her funds from the privacy contract to the user\u2019s public wallet. The withdrawing amount is visible on the chain but the remaining funds of the user held in the privacy contract is always hidden. Transaction fee and TaoZ integration \u00b6 TaoP utilizes TaoZ - the core protocol of Tao allowing gasless transactions in a decentralized way to anonymize msg.sender in anonymous send transactions to the privacy smart contract. TaoZ integration is very important to TaoP because of the way that it does not require an account to hold TAO to make a transaction. For example, when Alice wants to make an anonymous send transaction to the privacy contract, if Alice uses her private key to sign the transaction, every one would know that Alice is making a private transaction, which would destroy the anonymity property of the protocol. Having a third-party such as relayer to sign the transaction and pay the gas fee is promising but centralizing the protocol. Integrating with TaoZ allows to create a privacy fee vault that is initially deposited by the issuer/owner of the privacy contract. For every anonymous send transaction, Alice uses her private key to create cryptographic proofs: RingCT, Bulletproofs, a brand new account/private key without TAO is used for signing as msg.sender . The actual network fee will be paid from the privacy vault fee to masternodes through TaoZ protocol. On the other hand, to compensate the privacy transaction fee paid for masternodes, Alice sends a 0.01 TAO fee to the issuer/owner within the smart contract execution of the anonymous transaction. The transaction fee flow is as the following figure. Figure 2: Privacy transaction fee and TaoZ integration TaoP's privacy address \u00b6 TaoP uses a single private key to generate a dual-key system. The user private key s of the user's TAO address is called private spend key and v = SHA256(s) is the private view key of the user. As the names imply: Private spend key s : This is used for making cryptographic proofs for spending funds in the privacy contract. Private view key v : This is used for viewing the information of all transactions belonging to the user. Having v only allows seeing the transaction history of the user, but does not allow spending funds. This could be used as a tool for authorized parties to check the transaction history of a user by requiring the user to register her private view key to the authorized parties for regulatory compliance purposes. Each private spend key s has an associated privacy address. The latter is Base58 encoding of the public spend ( S ) and public view ( V ) keys derived from s and v . When Alice wants to make an anonymous send transaction to Bob , Bob needs to send his privacy address to Alice . Ring Confidential Transaction and Bulletproofs \u00b6 Confidential transaction \u00b6 Confidential transaction was proposed for Bitcoin privacy integration by Greg Maxwell. It uses Pedersen commitment to encrypt transaction amounts using randomly generated masks. Cryptographically, confidential transaction states that the sum of Pedersen commitments of all input notes must be equal to the sum of all Pedersen commitments of all output notes . Users are recommended to check confidential transaction to better understand how it works. What confidential transaction does not support is transaction sender anonymity, which is supported by Ring Confidential Transaction (RingCT) implemented by Monero. RingCT is the combination of Ring Signature and Confidential Transaction. Ring Signature allows to obfuscate transaction sender in an anonymity set, whose size is 12 in TaoP. RingCT, however, requires the support of a zero-knowledge range proof in order to prove the transaction amount committed in a Pedersen commitment is positive to prevent from double spending. This is supported by Bulletproofs which supports short non-interactive proofs without a trusted setup for confidential transactions. Range proofs with Bulletproofs \u00b6 Range proofs is a type of zero-knowledge proof used for proving that a secret value is within a value range without revealing the precise value of the secret. Bulletproofs is a new non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol with very short proofs and without a trusted setup; the proof size is only logarithmic in the witness size. TaoP uses Bulletproofs range proof to prove the transaction amount commited in Pedersen commitments is positive. Both Bulletproofs and RingCT are implemented in our privacy SDK . Implementation \u00b6 Privacy precompiled contracts \u00b6 To reduce the gas consumption of RingCT and Bulletproof verification, we propose two precompiled contracts, RingCTVerifier and BulletproofVerifier , that are implemented in the core EVM of Tao, using Golang. These two precompiled contracts will be called by the privacy contract to verify the confidential transaction and Bulletproof range proof, respectively. The current addresses for those precompiled contracts are 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000001e and 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000028. Anonymize TAO \u00b6 Anonymizing TAO is equal to making a deposit transaction to the privacy contract. The deposit transaction creates a new Note n in the privacy contract that has the following cryptographic elements: A transaction public key P tx A stealth, one-time public key P st A Pedersen commitment C of the deposit amount A deposit fee of 0.001 TAO is applied to pay transaction fees for the person who deposits to the privacy transaction fee vault. Once deposited, the privacy smart contract records that the person that has the private key corresponding to the deposit stealth public key has the deposit amount in a note. Anonymous send \u00b6 Suppose Bob wants to receive x TAO from Alice via an anonymous send transaction. Bob sends his privacy address to Alice Alice derives a stealth one-time public key Stealth b as follows: Alice decodes the Base58 privacy address of Bob to have the public spend S b and public view V b key of Bob . Alice generates a random 256-bit number transaction private key s tx and computes the corresponding transaction public key S tx = s tx *G . Alice computes the Elliptic Curve Diff Hellman (ECDH) E = s tx * V b Alice computes Stealth b = E * G + S b . Alice generates Pedersen commitment for the transaction amount x . Alice randomly generates a 256-bit number called mask m Alice creates a Pedersen commitment C = m*G + x*H Alice encrypts m and x using the Elliptic Curve Diff Hellman E with an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. Let's denote the cipher text produced by this encryption MX . Alice generates ring confidential transaction RingCT sig for the transaction (details are provided later). Alice generates a bulletproof range proof bp to prove that x is positive without revealing the value of x . Alice bundles ( S tx , Stealth b , C , MX , sig , bp ) into the data of a transaction, generates a random private key to sign the transaction (to anonymize msg.sender ), and sends the signed transaction to the privacy smart contract. The generation of RingCT and Bulletproofs will be posted in details in Tao's technical blog later. Note that RingCT is generated by taking into account the transaction fee of 0.01 TAO. The algorithm to generate sig is similar to the one described in Monero RingCT . In Step 6, TaoZ empowers the anonymization of msg.sender through the privacy fee vault and the paying of transaction fee within the internal execution of the privacy smart contract. Anonymous send transaction verification on smart contracts \u00b6 The privacy smart contract basically verifies: The existence of all input notes in the transaction The validity of the ring confidential transaction (RingCT) sig by calling RingCTVerifier precompiled contract. The validity of Bulletproofs bp by calling BulletproofVerifier precompiled contract. Anonymous reception of TAO \u00b6 Once the transaction is confirmed, Bob needs to scan all newly created notes on the privacy smart contract to recognize which one belongs to him. Bob uses his private view key to decode the encrypted transaction amount. A proof-of-concept code for the privacy contract can be found here . Due to the math complexity of RingCT and Bulletproofs, we omit the construction algorithms for those proofs here and will detail them in Tao's tech blog. Private token standard \u00b6 TaoP is designed to support private tokens issued on Tao. A new private token standard TRC2P will be supportec by extending the TRC2 token standard. Regulatory compliance \u00b6 By using a dual-key-like system, any user could register her/his private view key to an authorized authority. The latter will then be able to decode all transactions that involve the user but will not be able to create an anonymous send transaction. The authorized authority would be the goverment tax agency or any organization that allows to track user transactions for legal purposes. Even a bank could use TaoP to keep track of their user balance while leaving only authorized users with private spend keys to make transactions.

TaoP transactions are like Monero transactions but in a smart contract on the very fast blockchain Tao. Typically, funds flow as follows: A user anonymize her TAO by making a deposit transaction to send TAO to the privacy smart contract. This transaction is a normal transaction and does not hide the transaction amount. This transaction creates a Note in the privacy contract. A note is similar to the concept of Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) on Bitcoin blockchain with additional information, i.e. a Pedersen commitment, that is used for creating cryptographic proofs when the user wants to make an anonymous send transaction. The user makes anonymous send transactions from the user to a recipient. The transaction amount is hidden. Funds are not moved out of the privacy contract. The user uses her own private key to create RingCT and Bulletproofs for the privacy contract to verify. Anonymous send obfuscates transaction sender and receiver, and hides transaction amounts. The user can decide to de-anonymize her private TAO by withdrawing all or part of her funds from the privacy contract to the user\u2019s public wallet. The withdrawing amount is visible on the chain but the remaining funds of the user held in the privacy contract is always hidden.","title":"TaoP architecture"},{"location":"wp-and-research/privacy/#transaction-fee-and-taoz-integration","text":"TaoP utilizes TaoZ - the core protocol of Tao allowing gasless transactions in a decentralized way to anonymize msg.sender in anonymous send transactions to the privacy smart contract. TaoZ integration is very important to TaoP because of the way that it does not require an account to hold TAO to make a transaction. For example, when Alice wants to make an anonymous send transaction to the privacy contract, if Alice uses her private key to sign the transaction, every one would know that Alice is making a private transaction, which would destroy the anonymity property of the protocol. Having a third-party such as relayer to sign the transaction and pay the gas fee is promising but centralizing the protocol. Integrating with TaoZ allows to create a privacy fee vault that is initially deposited by the issuer/owner of the privacy contract. For every anonymous send transaction, Alice uses her private key to create cryptographic proofs: RingCT, Bulletproofs, a brand new account/private key without TAO is used for signing as msg.sender . The actual network fee will be paid from the privacy vault fee to masternodes through TaoZ protocol. On the other hand, to compensate the privacy transaction fee paid for masternodes, Alice sends a 0.01 TAO fee to the issuer/owner within the smart contract execution of the anonymous transaction.

A platform which would enable a \u201cDeFi for music\u201d brings with it not only a set of technological prerequisites, but consensus must remain true to the ethics and ideals of the music industry we have come to serve. It is towards these noble ends that we are creating the means to manifest that future: Tao2. The blockchain industry and the infrastructure of the Internet of Value are being built rapidly around the globe, and to many the atmosphere is eerily similar to the building of the Internet in the late \u201890s, with pioneers and dreamers coming together to build a new future. Tao is the first blockchain platform which has dedicated its focus to leveraging the latest of blockchain technologies towards a more democratized, egalitarian future for the music economy.

Abstract and Keywords \u00b6 Abstract \u00b6 This paper proposes a sharding architecture solution for the Tao public blockchain infrastructure. Besides the aims at significantly improving the transaction processing performance in the current Tao design with the Proof-of-Stake Voting (DPOS) consensus, the presented sharding is designed in order to support decentralized applications\u2019 performance. The solution uses DPOS for intra-shard consensus because DPOS provides two-second block-time and fast confirmation time. The paper identifies and solves cross-shard transactions for smart contract message calls chain and data availability problem in shard reshuffling. Specifically, we propose two cross-shard smart contract transaction schemes combined with a new smart contract deployment strategy that places dependent smart contracts onto the same shard. Moreover, we also address the data availability problem in state sharding when shard reshuffling takes place. In addition, to be able to provide security and safety for shards, we provide an incentive-driven mutual verification game that aims at offering fast transaction confirmation time and fast detection of a malicious behavior that creates fraudulent blocks. Masternodes of a shard that create a fraudulent block will be detected and penalized by losing all of their deposits to the node that detects the invalidity of the block.

Introduction \u00b6 Blockchain has become one of the most disruptive technologies that enable many decentralized applications, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, smart contract, voting and supply chain management. Blockchain proponents have been trying to inject it into this Industry 4.0 revolution era. In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to compete with many mainstream technologies, such as Visa and MasterCard processors in financial services. Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing these blockchain proponents: Bitcoin [1] and Ethereum [2] only can process around 7 and 15 transactions per second, respectively. Remember that, these numbers in Visa and MasterCard are around 5000-6000 transactions per seconds. Several scaling solutions have been proposed by the proponents, including on-chain and layer 2 scaling solutions. Off-chain scaling solutions are Lightning [3] network for Bitcoin, State Chanel [4] and Plasma [5] for Ethereum, just to name a few. Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system. Sharding challenges : Sharding is a technique that is inspired by the concept of database sharding in which the whole database is divided into sub-databases which will then be deployed on different servers. The goal is to parallelize the transaction processing by dividing the blockchain network into sub-networks each of which stores a portion of the whole blockchain and processes a subset of non-overlapping transactions. The application of sharding to decentralized blockchain systems has the following technical challenges that will be addressed in this paper: Assignment of masternodes to specific shards : This process is critical to ensure that masternodes are assigned to shards in a randomized manner to avoid an adaptive attack. In the latter, malicious masternodes can all join the same shard in order to collude it. Cross-shard transaction : Cross-shard transactions enable every account to transact with any other accounts. The challenge is how to execute cross-shard transactions securely and safely knowing that a cross-shard transaction involves more than two shards. Furthermore, the problem is even more challenging if the receiver is a smart contract. Cross-shard smart contract message calls chaining *: The problem of cross-shard transaction becomes very difficult if a smart contract in one shard calls another smart contract in another shard, which in turn invokes another contract in another shard. This cross-shard smart contract call chaining if not properly processed will be easy to attack and violate security requirements and harmful to the performance of the whole system. Shard reshuffling through randomization and data availability : The problem with state sharding is when the network reshuffles the set of masternodes for each shard after a period of time (often called epoch), the masternodes that switch from one shard to a new shard need to synchronize the current data of the new shard in order to execute new transactions for that shard. If not carefully treated, the data synchronization takes a significant amount of time and decreases the performance of the system. Previous works on sharding : Sharding has its origin from permissioned or closed distributed databases in which a centralized database is partitioned into smaller databases that store information related to a subset of users. The smaller databases are then maintained by trusted infrastructures provided by infrastructure providers such as Google or Amazon. However, the sharding in these closed distributed databases cannot be applied to public/permissionless blockchains in which one masternode does not have to trust in other masternodes in the Internet. Several blockchain-related works have been trying to propose a sharding solution that can leverage the transaction processing performance. In [6], Elastico is proposed as the first sharding solution for public blockchains. Elastico partitions the blockchain network into smaller committees, each of which then processes a disjoint set of transactions, called a shard. However, Elastico offers horizontal scaling but with high failure probabilities [12]. Zilliqa [7] inherits the sharding architecture solution from Elastico. Both Elastico and Zilliqa support network sharding and utilizes Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance [8] as intra-shard consensus. In these approaches, micro blocks, which are created by the shards, are then aggregated into a final block by another consensus round run among the final committee members. OmniLedger [9] using the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) provides atomic cross-shard transactions. A common missing feature of these aforementioned approaches is the lack of smart contract support. If two transactions from the senders in different shards, which execute the same smart contract, would cause concurrent conflict updates in the different shards to the state of the same smart contract. In this paper, we propose a sharding architecture for Tao but can be applied to any Proof-of-Stake-based blockchain systems to address the aforementioned issues. Furthermore, to be able to provide security and safety for shards, we provide an incentive-driven mutual verification game that aims at offering fast transaction confirmation time and fast detection of a malicious behavior that creates fraudulent blocks. Masternodes of a shard that create a fraudulent block will be detected and penalized by losing all of their deposits to the node that detects the invalidity of the block. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II describes the sharding architecture and the consensus protocol of the solution addressing the previously mentioned problem. Section III provides our solutions to different cross-shard transaction schemes. Section IV presents an incentive-driven mutual game verification game for fast transaction confirmation time and fast detection and penalization of malicious behaviors of attacking maternodes for strengthening security and safety. Section V details the reshuffling and data availability problem and solution. Finally, we conclude the paper and show some perspectives in Section VI. Sharding Architecture \u00b6 This section describes the sharding architecture and the used consensus protocol. We assume readers of this paper have basic understanding of our Proof-of-Stake Voting (DPOS) consensus protocol previously released and presented in [10]. However, to better describe the sharding architecture, we summarize some important information about Tao\u2019s DPOS. Specifically, Tao features a voting-based system to elect 150 Masternodes that are responsible for creating, verifying and finalizing the blocks created within a period, called epoch, which lasts for 900 of two-second block-times. Each coin-holder must deposit at least 50 000 TAO to a Voting smart contract and must satisfy a set of infrastructure requirements. The set of Masternodes is dynamically selected through votes made by coin-holders that send their tokens to the Voting smart contract. Sharding architecture overview \u00b6 Figure 1 shows the proposed sharding architecture. Without loss of generality, we suppose there are N masternodes that are selected among the candidates. The network of masternodes is assigned to specific shards using randomization sampling. This latter randomly divides the set of N masternodes into sub-groups of size c (either 10 or 15), namely the shard size, thus the total number of shards S in the network is N/c . This step is called network sharding. This step is repeated every epoch. Each shard also has an identifier numbered from 0 to ( S \u2013 1). Each shard/subgroup only stores a portion of the whole blockchain, instead of the whole blockchain as in existing blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The processing of a transaction assigned to a specific shard is based on the address of the sender of the transaction. A transaction tx is assigned to shard id if and only if log_2(N) rightmost bits of the transaction sender\u2019s address is equal to id . That means, each external owned account is managed by a specific shard, based on its address. Therefore, simple double-spending attacks by sending transactions to different shards are avoided. For example, transactions from address 0xabc..def and 0xabc...ded are processed by shard 15 (16th shard) and 13 (14th shard), respectively, if the total number of shards N = 16. There is also a root chain that interacts with shard chains. The root chain is used for securing the transactions in the shard chains. The root chain does not store details of transactions assigned to shards, but block hashes and the smart contracts used for voting and block finalization. Tao features a Voting smart contract that is for masternode candidates and coin-holders to deposit and vote for masternodes, respectively. In the sharding architecture, this smart contract is deployed on the root chain. Coin-holders interact with the Voting smart contract in the current Tao as they interact with the root chain in the sharding architecture. Every vote and deposit are recorded in the root chain. The blocks in the root chain are created and verified by a larger number of masternodes than shard chains\u2019 for securing the whole system (see Consensus protocol for more detailed discussion). Ideally, all masternodes are responsible for the root chain, just as they are maintaining Tao in DPOS. An interesting point is that the set of masternodes for the root chain does not need to do computation for transactions of specific shards, but only for creating blocks containing transactions to the consensus smart contracts (see [11] for detailed discussion). That means, the computation throughput is much smaller than that of the current DPOS because most of transactions happen in the shard chains. All masternodes will be creating and verifying blocks in the root chain and a shard chain, but there is no slot of two-second within which a masternode must create blocks for both the root chain and a shard chain. This is because it is very hard for a masternode to create two blocks within 2s. It is worth noting that, in order for attackers to create another longer shard chain than an existing shard chain, the attackers need to successfully revert both the shard chain and the root chain, which are unlikely to happen since the root chain is secured by all masternodes. Shard assignment through randomization sampling \u00b6 As a reminder, masternodes in Tao in an epoch is selected at the end of the previous epoch and there is also a randomization process during the previous epoch in order to select block verifiers for double validation. The addresses of the set of masternodes for next epoch is recorded in the Voting smart contract in a decreasing order of total votes for them. Each masternode is identified by its deposit wallet address. The goal of the shard assignment is to divide the address-identified N masternodes into subsets of masternodes, each of which process a disjoint set of transactions. To do that, an additional randomization process is executed during the previous epoch for shard assignment. Figure 1: The proposed sharding architecture solution The shard assignment is realized through randomization sampling that executes a pseudo random number generator function with a random seed agreed between the masternodes. We utilize the decentralized randomization algorithm that was previously introduced in our Tao Proof-of-Stake Voting consensus. The shard assignment has the following steps: Randomization: This step follows our previously proposed decentralized lock-recovery randomization scheme to compute a random seed which is unpredictable and not biased by any masternode. Shard assignment computation: Based on a random seed, we generate N random numbers using a pseudo random number generator. The N numbers are used in a permutation algorithm for sampling S sets of c masternodes. Figure 1 shows an example of the result of the decentralized randomization sampling process. The shards are communicated with each other through a cross-shard communication scheme, which is presented in the next section. Each shard sends their created blocks, block hashes and block signatures to the root chain that stores them in the Tao block signer smart contract (see Section Consensus protocol for more information). Consensus protocol \u00b6 In DPOS, there are currently two consensus smart contracts deployed onto Tao: Voting smart contract: This contract allows coin-holders to deposit (to become a masternode candidate), to vote for masternodes, to resign from the candidates list, to un-vote for masternodes, and to withdraw voted and deposited tokens. Block signer smart contract: Once a masternode verifies a block, the masternode signs off the block and sends the signature to the block signer smart contract. In the sharding architecture, these two smart contracts are deployed onto the root chain. Since the latter is verified by many masternodes, the smart contracts are secured. Proof-of-Stake Voting (DPOS) consensus with double validation and randomization is run among the set of masternodes of a shard. As a reminder, DPOS provides fast block-time and confirmation time, and a double validation technique for security enhancement. A block in DPOS is verified by both block creator, which creates the block, and block verifier, which verifies the block before adding it to the blockchain (see [10] for more information about block creator and block verifier in double validation). Other masternodes will then check whether the block verifier signs off on the block. Each masternode verifies a block by sending its signature for the block to the block signer smart contract on the root chain. A block in a shard is confirmed if \u00be masternodes of that shard verifies and signs it off. The confirmation time for intra-shard transactions can be almost instant, just as what is provided by DPOS without sharding. The root chain does not need to do re-computation for verifying blocks created by shard chains. The root chain is secure since it is maintained by all masternodes in the network. A double-spending attack to a shard needs to revert both the shard chain and the root chain, which is unlikely to happen. There is a small probability that a shard is colluded, in which more than its \u00be masternodes are attackers that do an adaptive attack. These attackers can create invalid blocks to create, for example, money out of thin air. In order to deal with this issue, we provide a game theory incentive-driven approach that is similar to Plasma. This approach is presented in Section IV. Cross-shard Transaction Schemes \u00b6 Cross-shard transaction \u00b6 A cross-shard transaction involves sending some coins from a sender in one shard to a receiver in another shard. It enables any account in a shard to transact with any other account in other shards. Our Lock-Commit cross-shard transaction requires cross-shard communication and is processed in two steps as follows: Lock at sending shard: The transaction is first processed by the sender shard which decreases the balance of the sender account. At the end of this phase, a lock transaction receipt is generated which is signed by the masternode which produces the block containing the transaction. The receipt is only generated if the transaction has been finalized (A block is considered as \u201cfinalized\u201d meaning that it is irreversible and any attempt to modify it is refused by the network) by the shard (the block is verified and signed by \u00be the number of masternodes of the shard sending their signatures to the Block Signer smart contract on the root chain). It plays the role of a Proof-of-Acceptance which is then sent to the receiver shard for processing. The Proof-of-Acceptance consists of the transaction, the Merkle proof of the transaction in the block at the sender shard, and the finality proof of the block. Commitment at receiving shard: The leader of the receiver shard sends the Proof-of-Acceptance for the transaction at the lock phase to the receiver shard. This latter processes the proof as a transaction which might increase the balance of the receiver. An issue of this commitment phase is that the malicious masternodes in the receiver shard might ignore the commit transaction, thus leaving the whole transaction stuck (because the sender\u2019s balance is decreased while the receiver\u2019s balance is not increased). However, because masternodes take turns to create blocks in a round-robin manner following the DPOS consensus, the proof will eventually be added to a block created by an honest masternode, even though one or several malicious masternodes might ignore the proof transaction. This liveness property is discussed in details in our previous technical paper for DPOS consensus. Figure 2 shows an illustrative example of a smart contract call cross-shard transaction. One of the complications of this transaction scheme is how to refund the left gas after the execution of the smart contract at the receiver shard completes. The left gas should be returned back to the sender (User) of the transaction in the sender shard. With that being said, in order to completely confirm a smart contract call cross-shard transaction, one must wait until all these back-and-forth phases between these shards are confirmed one-by-one. Therefore, the transaction confirmation latency increases, which is not expected from user perspectives, despite the significant increase of transaction volume. To deal with this issue, we propose another cross-shard transaction scheme, namely transfer-first cross-shard transaction scheme (TFC). In this latter, instead of directly doing a smart contract call cross-shard transaction, the sender at one shard can: Send the expected amount to another external account that is managed by herself/himself at the receiver shard through a simple balance transfer. Note that, this latter still requires the Lock-Commit scheme to make simple balance transfer. However, Lock-Commit scheme for simple balance transfer does not involve the complexity of gas refund as for smart contracts. This is because the Lock-Commit scheme for cross-shard simple balance transfer will consume a fixed amount gas (the gas for two balance transfers or 2300*2 gas). Use the controlled external account to interact with all smart contracts in the receiver shard. All transactions started by this external account within the receiver shard will then be confirmed almost instantly as provided by the DPOS consensus. While this transfer-first cross-shard transaction scheme helps maintain the fast transaction confirmation property of DPOS, it raises another issue: a user must manage as many accounts as the number of shards in the system in order to be able to instantly interact with all smart contracts and decentralized applications deployed on all shards. In order to alleviate this complicated account management issue, we intend to integrate an account management layer into our TAO wallet. This layer is to help users manage their accounts in different shards as a single account in the current Tao design. It brings transparency to users as they are interacting with a one-shard system. When a user wants to make a transaction, the wallet does as follows: The account management layer specifies the target shard ID, based on the address of the receiver of the transaction. If the receiver is an external owned account, a simple transfer transaction is created and broadcast to the masternodes network. If the receiver is a smart contract, the account management layer verifies whether the address A0 corresponding to the target shard has the expected amount of token for the transaction. If the balance is not sufficient, a transfer transaction from one of the accounts in other shards to the address A0. Then, the transaction to the smart contract is created and sent to the masternodes network. *Figure 2: Smart contract call cross-shard transaction * One issue with this cross-shard transaction scheme is that the transaction fee would be higher than the non-sharding blockchain system since any cross-shard transaction must pay an additional fee at the sender shard of the transaction for the Lock at sending shard phase. However, the issue can be alleviated if the scheme is implemented along with a near-zero fee transaction system such as Tao. Smart contract message calls chain \u00b6 A smart contract, executed within a shard, might call another smart contract managed by another shard in the middle of its execution. Many smart contracts can be involved in a smart contract message calls chain. This is a very challenging problem because the execution of a caller smart contract in a caller shard cannot suspend and wait for the completion and finality of the callee smart contract in a callee shard. If that is the case, both the caller and callee shards would be suspended, thus significantly decreasing the performance of the whole system. The problem might be more harmful if the smart contract message calls chain involves many shards. Let\u2019s illustrate this challenge by the example in Figure 3 with the corresponding solidity source code in Figure 4. Suppose a user sends a transaction to a smart contract SC1 in order to call method m1 of SC1. The execution of the latter in Shard1 executes the method m2 of Shard2, which in turn makes another message call to SC3 in Shard3. For simplification, we assume that the user\u2019s address is managed by Shard1. Otherwise, the user can use the TFC cross-shard transaction scheme presented previously. The TFC cross-shard transaction scheme previously presented in Cross-shard transaction is not applicable to the illustrative example. The reason is that, the method calls between smart contracts are not transactions, but message calls. Message calls are not directly written to the blockchain. Even if we can wisely consider message calls as transactions in this case, the message call m1 to m2 executed in Shard1 must wait for the message call in Shard2 to be confirmed, which in turns needs to wait for the message call in Shard3 to be confirmed. This wait-for-confirmation chain critically decreases the performance of the system since the operations of waiting shards are blocked. Figure 3: Smart contract message calls chain example Figure 4: Solidity example for smart contract message calls chain In order to deal with this problem, we propose to group all smart contracts in a message calls chain and deploy them onto the same shard. With that being said, for the illustrative example, the smart contracts SC1, SC2 and SC3 are all deployed onto the shard onto which SC3 is deployed. This is because SC3 is the first contract among the three to be deployed. By this way, any smart contract message calls chain transaction is always executed within one single shard. Therefore, the aforementioned problem is eliminated. There is one issue that this solution cannot deal with is when a contract A calls two independent contracts B and C, which are respectively previously placed onto different shards. We approach this issue by early detecting this problem through an off-chain smart contract analysis when the user wants to deploy this smart contract A to the network. Then, an exception is raised that does not allow to place A onto the network. Incentive-driven Mutual Verification Game for Safety and Security \u00b6 Sharding is usually considered when the system has many participating nodes. This is because higher number of nodes per shard decreases the probability that a shard is colluded meaning that invalid blocks created by a colluded shard can be finalized. In order to make sharding applicable to blockchain systems with smaller number of nodes per shard, i.e. 10 nodes per shard, while still maintaining its security, we propose to use a game theory incentive-driven mechanism which is currently utilized by Plasma. Concretely, a shard is monitored by one or multiple challengers. The latter can be either independent nodes or masternodes in the root chain. They act as full nodes and receive all transactions and blocks processed by the monitored shard and verify all of these blocks. If a processed transaction is detected as invalid, i.e. the transaction is mal-formed or creates money out of thin air, the challenger sends a proof-of-invalidation or fraud proof to the root chain. The incentive for the challenger is that if a transaction is successfully challenged, the challenger gets rewarded as the total deposited tokens of the masternodes that have validated the invalid block. In contrast, all of the masternodes that have verified the invalid block are penalized by losing all of their deposited tokens to the challenger. Note that, non-masternode challengers do not have to deposit any amount of tokens. There are two safety concerns about this incentive-driven approach: Motivation for challengers: Non-masternodes challengers are expected to actively monitor the network to get incentives for invalid blocks. However, in the long term, non-masternodes are only motivated for monitoring the network if there are occasional invalid blocks so that the non-masternodes challengers can compensate for the cost of operating and monitoring the network. If there are no invalid blocks for a long period, the challengers will eventually be discouraged for this monitoring task, thus leaving a safety issue for the attackers in a colluded shard to create invalid blocks. The latter then can be falsely finalized because all non-masternodes challengers turn off their monitoring task since they cannot pay operational costs for monitoring the network. Data availability: Data availability is a strict requirement for the challengers to be able to detect invalidity. Without data, it is impossible to claim fraud proofs. For example, when a new shard block is created, any challenger needs the shard block, the previous state of the shard chain, and the signatures of the attacker masternodes verifying the invalid block, in order to have enough evidence to penalize the attackers. Therefore, all attackers would choose to refuse to broadcast their created blocks to honest nodes. This is because if a shard is colluded, all of the attackers within that shard can finalize an invalid block without sending any block data to honest nodes. We tackle the two aforementioned concerns as follows: Masternode candidates can become challengers to monitor the network and get incentives if some masternodes verify an invalid block. These candidates have incentives to monitor the network to detect the malicious behavior since whether having monitored or not, they still have to pay operational and monitoring costs. Furthermore, monitoring the network is also one of the ways to show its performance for coin-holders to vote it to become a masternode. In addition, if a masternode candidate chooses to not receive shard blocks and later on it is elected as a masternode assigned to a shard, the elected masternode will not be able to verify or create any shard blocks, which in turn lowers its performance. Eventually, the elected masternode will be quickly voted out of the masternode list by the coin-holders. Shard blocks and masternodes\u2019 signatures produced by maternodes need to be propagated to the root chain in order to finalize the blocks. All masternodes then have chance of verifying the validity of the shard blocks to detect the malicious behavior and get incentives. We call this mechanism an incentive-driven mutual verification game. If one shard is colluded and an invalid block is produced by attackers, whether the attackers in the shard want to or not, they have to send the invalid block to the root chain to finalize. Exposing an invalid block to the root chain is extremely risky for the attackers to lose all of their deposits (note that, masternodes are not required to verify blocks submitted to the root chain (that makes computation throughput on the root chain significantly less than the shard chains\u2019). Masternodes can propagate the shard blocks submitted to the root chain to the masternode candidates or any challenger that will verify the validity of the shard blocks, which solves the data availability problem in this case). It is worth noting that, the attackers have no incentives to not propagate invalid blocks to the root chain. This is because, by doing so, the attackers have spent computation resources and operational costs for only locally postponing the transactions within one shard. Furthermore, the attackers will be voted out of the masternode list because of their low performance and these postponed transactions will then be processed by the same shard but with a different set of masternodes once network reshuffling has been executed. Fraud proofs : If a block with an invalid state transition is signed off and propagated throughout the network, any other participant who receives the block can submit a merkleized fraud proof to the Voting smart contract (note that, the Voting smart contract contains all deposits and voted tokens, therefore, the penalty for masternodes creating invalid blocks will be executed by a function within the contract. The penalty function is executed once a fraud proof for an invalid block is submitted by any nodes) on the root chain and the shard chain rejects the invalid block and is rolled back. Fraud proofs ensure that all state transitions are validated. Example fraud proofs are proof of transaction spendability (funds are available in the current shard), proof-of-state transition (including checking the signature for the ability a transaction can be validated and executed, proof of inclusion/exclusion across blocks, and deposit/withdrawal proofs). In order for this construction to have minimal proofs, though, all blocks must provide a commitment to a merkleized trie of the current state, a trie of outputs spent, a merkle tree of transactions, and a reference to the prior state being modified. The fraud proofs and the incentive-driven mutual verification game combined with double validation ensure that a coalition of participants is not able to create invalid blocks that can be finalized without getting penalized. This ensures that the challengers always have access to shard blocks, thus are able to prove (and therefore discourage) invalid state transitions in shard blocks. Compared to TrueBit and Plasma: TrueBit [11] and Plasma [5] both use an incentive-driven verification game approach to provide scalable and secure solutions. Similar to our argument on the incentives for challengers to observe the network, the authors of TrueBit argue that, if there is no chance of finding a bug in the blocks, challengers will likely refuse to continue the monitoring task. In order to motivate the challengers to actively observe the network, TrueBit proposes to provide \u201cforced errors\u201d. These errors are produced at random and unpredictable time. The main objective of blocks with forced errors is to incentivize the challengers and keep them motivated to secure the network. These blocks are special and the creators and validators of these blocks are not penalized. Plasma provides an \u201cexit\u201d mechanism that aims at resolving the data availability problem. Specifically, in Plasma, when a participant cannot access block data of a Plasma chain, the participant can move her asset/token from the Plasma chain to the root chain (or the parent Plasma chain) by executing the \u201cexit\u201d mechanism. The participant then needs to wait for an amount of time, i.e. 1 week, in order for other participants to submit a fraud proof if the exit execution is falsified. In order to maintain fast confirmation time as in the current Tao DPOS design and to have the shards\u2019 liveness, our approach is driven by an incentive and mutual verification game. The latter aims at providing both fast confirmation and detection of Byzantiness of a block. By utilizing the very strong incentivizing-penalizing incentive-driven mutual verification game, challengers are strongly encouraged to work hard in order to keep the system safe and secure and shard masternodes are discouraged to act maliciously. Reshuffling and Data Availability \u00b6 To enhance further the security of shards, it is very important that shards should be dynamic for resilience against attacks and failures of nodes in a shard. For example, one shard might be stuck in a situation where blocks are valid but cannot be finalized because attacking masternodes do not validate these blocks. A technique for dealing with this problem is to reshuffle the masternodes assigned to the shards. This means the set of masternodes for each shard is changed dynamically every epoch. At the end of each epoch, the randomization sampling is repeated for a different set of masternodes elected to participate into shards. Reshuffling enhances the security and resilience of the system. However, it introduces a new challenge: the data availability problem. In the latter, every masternode joining to a new shard must synchronize the blockchain portion of this new shard in order to be able to verify transactions belonging to it. If the portion is too large and the synchronization time is too short, the entire shard cannot verify any transaction, thus renders the shard useless for the whole synchronization time. This problem can be tackled by the following strategies:: Shard masternodes storing all states of other shards: It requires that all masternodes, even non-shard member nodes, must receive and store all of the portions of state in all shards. This solution allows for any masternodes to smoothly switch from one shard to or join any other shard without needing a data synchronization time. Gradual reshuffling: Instead of resampling the whole set of masternodes assigned to each shard at the end of each epoch, the reshuffling might only pull a subset of masternodes out of a shard while leaving the remainder intact, i.e. 1/10 of the masternodes are kicked out from a shard while the other masternodes still stay in the shard and the resampling takes c/10 (c is the shard size) masternodes randomly from the set of masternode candidates. Since the latter have been synchronizing all blocks (see Section IV for more information), the system can smoothly continue the operations without interrupting time for data synchronization. Randomization sampling in advance: Still using the strategy of giving masternodes joining new shards some amount of time to download the blockchain data of a shard, this approach lets the network execute the randomization sampling in the middle of an epoch. Therefore, assigned masternodes will know ahead of time to which shard they will contribute in the next epoch. In this fashion, these in-advance assigned masternodes will have enough time to download the blockchain data of the assigned shard to prepare for the next epoch. Currently, we have been leaning towards the first and second strategy because these solutions are more implementable and analyzable for security. These strategies will be rigorously analyzed before making a final decision since both have its own advantages and limitations. While the first strategy has advantage of simplicity and masternodes and candidates can switch from one shard to any other shard smoothly, the storage and network bandwidth of masternodes might be more needed. On the other hand, the second strategy can save more storage and network bandwidth, it raises a question: which masternodes should be kicked out of a shard if the performance of all masternodes in that shard is efficiently equal to each other\u2019s. Conclusion \u00b6 The paper has presented a new solution to sharding architecture for public blockchains. It aims at being transparent to users and significantly improving the transaction processing performance, while still maintaining basic security requirements of the system. The paper uniquely identified and solved cross-shard transactions for smart contract call chaining and data availability problem in shard reshuffling. The proposed solution uses the Proof-of-Stake Voting (DPOS) efficient consensus protocol proposed by Tao for intra-shard consensus. Specifically, we relied on our decentralized randomization algorithm for randomized shard assignment of masternodes and proposed two cross-shard smart contract transaction schemes combined with a new smart contract deployment strategy. The latter places dependent smart contracts onto the same shard, which eliminates smart contract message calls chain problem involving multiple shards. In order to ensure safety and security of shards, we proposed an incentive-driven mutual verification game. In this latter, masternodes that create and/or verify an invalid block are penalized by losing all of their deposits to any participant that detects the invalidity by providing fraud proofs. Moreover, we also discuss the data availability problem in state sharding when shard reshuffling takes place and propose several possible solutions. We are currently analyzing rigorously the safety and security properties of the proposed architecture to show its soundness. In future, once the analysis will have been done, we will implement the proposed architecture on top of the Tao blockchain. References \u00b6 [1] S.

Blockchain proponents have been trying to inject it into this Industry 4.0 revolution era. In order to reach this goal, the current blockchain infrastructure must at least be able to compete with many mainstream technologies, such as Visa and MasterCard processors in financial services. Nevertheless, the reality is disappointing these blockchain proponents: Bitcoin [1] and Ethereum [2] only can process around 7 and 15 transactions per second, respectively. Remember that, these numbers in Visa and MasterCard are around 5000-6000 transactions per seconds. Several scaling solutions have been proposed by the proponents, including on-chain and layer 2 scaling solutions. Off-chain scaling solutions are Lightning [3] network for Bitcoin, State Chanel [4] and Plasma [5] for Ethereum, just to name a few. Regarding on-chain scaling, Sharding and Proof-of-Stake-based consensus are of potential that can significantly improve transaction processing performance while trying to maintain security requirements of the system. Sharding challenges : Sharding is a technique that is inspired by the concept of database sharding in which the whole database is divided into sub-databases which will then be deployed on different servers. The goal is to parallelize the transaction processing by dividing the blockchain network into sub-networks each of which stores a portion of the whole blockchain and processes a subset of non-overlapping transactions. The application of sharding to decentralized blockchain systems has the following technical challenges that will be addressed in this paper: Assignment of masternodes to specific shards : This process is critical to ensure that masternodes are assigned to shards in a randomized manner to avoid an adaptive attack. In the latter, malicious masternodes can all join the same shard in order to collude it. Cross-shard transaction : Cross-shard transactions enable every account to transact with any other accounts. The challenge is how to execute cross-shard transactions securely and safely knowing that a cross-shard transaction involves more than two shards. Furthermore, the problem is even more challenging if the receiver is a smart contract. Cross-shard smart contract message calls chaining *: The problem of cross-shard transaction becomes very difficult if a smart contract in one shard calls another smart contract in another shard, which in turn invokes another contract in another shard. This cross-shard smart contract call chaining if not properly processed will be easy to attack and violate security requirements and harmful to the performance of the whole system. Shard reshuffling through randomization and data availability : The problem with state sharding is when the network reshuffles the set of masternodes for each shard after a period of time (often called epoch), the masternodes that switch from one shard to a new shard need to synchronize the current data of the new shard in order to execute new transactions for that shard. If not carefully treated, the data synchronization takes a significant amount of time and decreases the performance of the system. Previous works on sharding : Sharding has its origin from permissioned or closed distributed databases in which a centralized database is partitioned into smaller databases that store information related to a subset of users. The smaller databases are then maintained by trusted infrastructures provided by infrastructure providers such as Google or Amazon. However, the sharding in these closed distributed databases cannot be applied to public/permissionless blockchains in which one masternode does not have to trust in other masternodes in the Internet. Several blockchain-related works have been trying to propose a sharding solution that can leverage the transaction processing performance. In [6], Elastico is proposed as the first sharding solution for public blockchains. Elastico partitions the blockchain network into smaller committees, each of which then processes a disjoint set of transactions, called a shard. However, Elastico offers horizontal scaling but with high failure probabilities [12]. Zilliqa [7] inherits the sharding architecture solution from Elastico. Both Elastico and Zilliqa support network sharding and utilizes Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance [8] as intra-shard consensus. In these approaches, micro blocks, which are created by the shards, are then aggregated into a final block by another consensus round run among the final committee members. OmniLedger [9] using the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) provides atomic cross-shard transactions. A common missing feature of these aforementioned approaches is the lack of smart contract support. If two transactions from the senders in different shards, which execute the same smart contract, would cause concurrent conflict updates in the different shards to the state of the same smart contract. In this paper, we propose a sharding architecture for Tao but can be applied to any Proof-of-Stake-based blockchain systems to address the aforementioned issues. Furthermore, to be able to provide security and safety for shards, we provide an incentive-driven mutual verification game that aims at offering fast transaction confirmation time and fast detection of a malicious behavior that creates fraudulent blocks. Masternodes of a shard that create a fraudulent block will be detected and penalized by losing all of their deposits to the node that detects the invalidity of the block. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II describes the sharding architecture and the consensus protocol of the solution addressing the previously mentioned problem. Section III provides our solutions to different cross-shard transaction schemes. Section IV presents an incentive-driven mutual game verification game for fast transaction confirmation time and fast detection and penalization of malicious behaviors of attacking maternodes for strengthening security and safety. Section V details the reshuffling and data availability problem and solution. Finally, we conclude the paper and show some perspectives in Section VI.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"wp-and-research/sharding-paper/#sharding-architecture","text":"This section describes the sharding architecture and the used consensus protocol. We assume readers of this paper have basic understanding of our Proof-of-Stake Voting (DPOS) consensus protocol previously released and presented in [10]. However, to better describe the sharding architecture, we summarize some important information about Tao\u2019s DPOS. Specifically, Tao features a voting-based system to elect 150 Masternodes that are responsible for creating, verifying and finalizing the blocks created within a period, called epoch, which lasts for 900 of two-second block-times. Each coin-holder must deposit at least 50 000 TAO to a Voting smart contract and must satisfy a set of infrastructure requirements. The set of Masternodes is dynamically selected through votes made by coin-holders that send their tokens to the Voting smart contract.","title":"Sharding Architecture"},{"location":"wp-and-research/sharding-paper/#sharding-architecture-overview","text":"Figure 1 shows the proposed sharding architecture. Without loss of generality, we suppose there are N masternodes that are selected among the candidates. The network of masternodes is assigned to specific shards using randomization sampling. This latter randomly divides the set of N masternodes into sub-groups of size c (either 10 or 15), namely the shard size, thus the total number of shards S in the network is N/c . This step is called network sharding. This step is repeated every epoch. Each shard also has an identifier numbered from 0 to ( S \u2013 1). Each shard/subgroup only stores a portion of the whole blockchain, instead of the whole blockchain as in existing blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The processing of a transaction assigned to a specific shard is based on the address of the sender of the transaction. A transaction tx is assigned to shard id if and only if log_2(N) rightmost bits of the transaction sender\u2019s address is equal to id . That means, each external owned account is managed by a specific shard, based on its address. Therefore, simple double-spending attacks by sending transactions to different shards are avoided. For example, transactions from address 0xabc..def and 0xabc...ded are processed by shard 15 (16th shard) and 13 (14th shard), respectively, if the total number of shards N = 16. There is also a root chain that interacts with shard chains. The root chain is used for securing the transactions in the shard chains. The root chain does not store details of transactions assigned to shards, but block hashes and the smart contracts used for voting and block finalization. Tao features a Voting smart contract that is for masternode candidates and coin-holders to deposit and vote for masternodes, respectively. In the sharding architecture, this smart contract is deployed on the root chain. Coin-holders interact with the Voting smart contract in the current Tao as they interact with the root chain in the sharding architecture. Every vote and deposit are recorded in the root chain. The blocks in the root chain are created and verified by a larger number of masternodes than shard chains\u2019 for securing the whole system (see Consensus protocol for more detailed discussion). Ideally, all masternodes are responsible for the root chain, just as they are maintaining Tao in DPOS. An interesting point is that the set of masternodes for the root chain does not need to do computation for transactions of specific shards, but only for creating blocks containing transactions to the consensus smart contracts (see [11] for detailed discussion). That means, the computation throughput is much smaller than that of the current DPOS because most of transactions happen in the shard chains. All masternodes will be creating and verifying blocks in the root chain and a shard chain, but there is no slot of two-second within which a masternode must create blocks for both the root chain and a shard chain. This is because it is very hard for a masternode to create two blocks within 2s. It is worth noting that, in order for attackers to create another longer shard chain than an existing shard chain, the attackers need to successfully revert both the shard chain and the root chain, which are unlikely to happen since the root chain is secured by all masternodes.","title":"Sharding architecture overview"},{"location":"wp-and-research/sharding-paper/#shard-assignment-through-randomization-sampling","text":"As a reminder, masternodes in Tao in an epoch is selected at the end of the previous epoch and there is also a randomization process during the previous epoch in order to select block verifiers for double validation. The addresses of the set of masternodes for next epoch is recorded in the Voting smart contract in a decreasing order of total votes for them. Each masternode is identified by its deposit wallet address. The goal of the shard assignment is to divide the address-identified N masternodes into subsets of masternodes, each of which process a disjoint set of transactions. To do that, an additional randomization process is executed during the previous epoch for shard assignment. Figure 1: The proposed sharding architecture solution The shard assignment is realized through randomization sampling that executes a pseudo random number generator function with a random seed agreed between the masternodes. We utilize the decentralized randomization algorithm that was previously introduced in our Tao Proof-of-Stake Voting consensus. The shard assignment has the following steps: Randomization: This step follows our previously proposed decentralized lock-recovery randomization scheme to compute a random seed which is unpredictable and not biased by any masternode. Shard assignment computation: Based on a random seed, we generate N random numbers using a pseudo random number generator. The N numbers are used in a permutation algorithm for sampling S sets of c masternodes. Figure 1 shows an example of the result of the decentralized randomization sampling process. The shards are communicated with each other through a cross-shard communication scheme, which is presented in the next section. Each shard sends their created blocks, block hashes and block signatures to the root chain that stores them in the Tao block signer smart contract (see Section Consensus protocol for more information).","title":"Shard assignment through randomization sampling"},{"location":"wp-and-research/sharding-paper/#consensus-protocol","text":"In DPOS, there are currently two consensus smart contracts deployed onto Tao: Voting smart contract: This contract allows coin-holders to deposit (to become a masternode candidate), to vote for masternodes, to resign from the candidates list, to un-vote for masternodes, and to withdraw voted and deposited tokens. Block signer smart contract: Once a masternode verifies a block, the masternode signs off the block and sends the signature to the block signer smart contract. In the sharding architecture, these two smart contracts are deployed onto the root chain. Since the latter is verified by many masternodes, the smart contracts are secured. Proof-of-Stake Voting (DPOS) consensus with double validation and randomization is run among the set of masternodes of a shard. As a reminder, DPOS provides fast block-time and confirmation time, and a double validation technique for security enhancement. A block in DPOS is verified by both block creator, which creates the block, and block verifier, which verifies the block before adding it to the blockchain (see [10] for more information about block creator and block verifier in double validation). Other masternodes will then check whether the block verifier signs off on the block. Each masternode verifies a block by sending its signature for the block to the block signer smart contract on the root chain. A block in a shard is confirmed if \u00be masternodes of that shard verifies and signs it off. The confirmation time for intra-shard transactions can be almost instant, just as what is provided by DPOS without sharding. The root chain does not need to do re-computation for verifying blocks created by shard chains. The root chain is secure since it is maintained by all masternodes in the network. A double-spending attack to a shard needs to revert both the shard chain and the root chain, which is unlikely to happen. There is a small probability that a shard is colluded, in which more than its \u00be masternodes are attackers that do an adaptive attack. These attackers can create invalid blocks to create, for example, money out of thin air. In order to deal with this issue, we provide a game theory incentive-driven approach that is similar to Plasma. This approach is presented in Section IV.","title":"Consensus protocol"},{"location":"wp-and-research/sharding-paper/#cross-shard-transaction-schemes","text":"","title":"Cross-shard Transaction Schemes"},{"location":"wp-and-research/sharding-paper/#cross-shard-transaction","text":"A cross-shard transaction involves sending some coins from a sender in one shard to a receiver in another shard. It enables any account in a shard to transact with any other account in other shards. Our Lock-Commit cross-shard transaction requires cross-shard communication and is processed in two steps as follows: Lock at sending shard: The transaction is first processed by the sender shard which decreases the balance of the sender account. At the end of this phase, a lock transaction receipt is generated which is signed by the masternode which produces the block containing the transaction. The receipt is only generated if the transaction has been finalized (A block is considered as \u201cfinalized\u201d meaning that it is irreversible and any attempt to modify it is refused by the network) by the shard (the block is verified and signed by \u00be the number of masternodes of the shard sending their signatures to the Block Signer smart contract on the root chain). It plays the role of a Proof-of-Acceptance which is then sent to the receiver shard for processing. The Proof-of-Acceptance consists of the transaction, the Merkle proof of the transaction in the block at the sender shard, and the finality proof of the block. Commitment at receiving shard: The leader of the receiver shard sends the Proof-of-Acceptance for the transaction at the lock phase to the receiver shard. This latter processes the proof as a transaction which might increase the balance of the receiver. An issue of this commitment phase is that the malicious masternodes in the receiver shard might ignore the commit transaction, thus leaving the whole transaction stuck (because the sender\u2019s balance is decreased while the receiver\u2019s balance is not increased). However, because masternodes take turns to create blocks in a round-robin manner following the DPOS consensus, the proof will eventually be added to a block created by an honest masternode, even though one or several malicious masternodes might ignore the proof transaction. This liveness property is discussed in details in our previous technical paper for DPOS consensus. Figure 2 shows an illustrative example of a smart contract call cross-shard transaction. One of the complications of this transaction scheme is how to refund the left gas after the execution of the smart contract at the receiver shard completes. The left gas should be returned back to the sender (User) of the transaction in the sender shard. With that being said, in order to completely confirm a smart contract call cross-shard transaction, one must wait until all these back-and-forth phases between these shards are confirmed one-by-one. Therefore, the transaction confirmation latency increases, which is not expected from user perspectives, despite the significant increase of transaction volume. To deal with this issue, we propose another cross-shard transaction scheme, namely transfer-first cross-shard transaction scheme (TFC). In this latter, instead of directly doing a smart contract call cross-shard transaction, the sender at one shard can: Send the expected amount to another external account that is managed by herself/himself at the receiver shard through a simple balance transfer. Note that, this latter still requires the Lock-Commit scheme to make simple balance transfer. However, Lock-Commit scheme for simple balance transfer does not involve the complexity of gas refund as for smart contracts. This is because the Lock-Commit scheme for cross-shard simple balance transfer will consume a fixed amount gas (the gas for two balance transfers or 2300*2 gas). Use the controlled external account to interact with all smart contracts in the receiver shard. All transactions started by this external account within the receiver shard will then be confirmed almost instantly as provided by the DPOS consensus. While this transfer-first cross-shard transaction scheme helps maintain the fast transaction confirmation property of DPOS, it raises another issue: a user must manage as many accounts as the number of shards in the system in order to be able to instantly interact with all smart contracts and decentralized applications deployed on all shards. In order to alleviate this complicated account management issue, we intend to integrate an account management layer into our TAO wallet. This layer is to help users manage their accounts in different shards as a single account in the current Tao design. It brings transparency to users as they are interacting with a one-shard system. When a user wants to make a transaction, the wallet does as follows: The account management layer specifies the target shard ID, based on the address of the receiver of the transaction. If the receiver is an external owned account, a simple transfer transaction is created and broadcast to the masternodes network. If the receiver is a smart contract, the account management layer verifies whether the address A0 corresponding to the target shard has the expected amount of token for the transaction. If the balance is not sufficient, a transfer transaction from one of the accounts in other shards to the address A0. Then, the transaction to the smart contract is created and sent to the masternodes network. *Figure 2: Smart contract call cross-shard transaction * One issue with this cross-shard transaction scheme is that the transaction fee would be higher than the non-sharding blockchain system since any cross-shard transaction must pay an additional fee at the sender shard of the transaction for the Lock at sending shard phase. However, the issue can be alleviated if the scheme is implemented along with a near-zero fee transaction system such as Tao.","title":"Cross-shard transaction"},{"location":"wp-and-research/sharding-paper/#smart-contract-message-calls-chain","text":"A smart contract, executed within a shard, might call another smart contract managed by another shard in the middle of its execution. Many smart contracts can be involved in a smart contract message calls chain. This is a very challenging problem because the execution of a caller smart contract in a caller shard cannot suspend and wait for the completion and finality of the callee smart contract in a callee shard. If that is the case, both the caller and callee shards would be suspended, thus significantly decreasing the performance of the whole system. The problem might be more harmful if the smart contract message calls chain involves many shards. Let\u2019s illustrate this challenge by the example in Figure 3 with the corresponding solidity source code in Figure 4. Suppose a user sends a transaction to a smart contract SC1 in order to call method m1 of SC1. The execution of the latter in Shard1 executes the method m2 of Shard2, which in turn makes another message call to SC3 in Shard3. For simplification, we assume that the user\u2019s address is managed by Shard1. Otherwise, the user can use the TFC cross-shard transaction scheme presented previously. The TFC cross-shard transaction scheme previously presented in Cross-shard transaction is not applicable to the illustrative example. The reason is that, the method calls between smart contracts are not transactions, but message calls. Message calls are not directly written to the blockchain. Even if we can wisely consider message calls as transactions in this case, the message call m1 to m2 executed in Shard1 must wait for the message call in Shard2 to be confirmed, which in turns needs to wait for the message call in Shard3 to be confirmed. This wait-for-confirmation chain critically decreases the performance of the system since the operations of waiting shards are blocked. Figure 3: Smart contract message calls chain example Figure 4: Solidity example for smart contract message calls chain In order to deal with this problem, we propose to group all smart contracts in a message calls chain and deploy them onto the same shard. With that being said, for the illustrative example, the smart contracts SC1, SC2 and SC3 are all deployed onto the shard onto which SC3 is deployed. This is because SC3 is the first contract among the three to be deployed. By this way, any smart contract message calls chain transaction is always executed within one single shard. Therefore, the aforementioned problem is eliminated. There is one issue that this solution cannot deal with is when a contract A calls two independent contracts B and C, which are respectively previously placed onto different shards. We approach this issue by early detecting this problem through an off-chain smart contract analysis when the user wants to deploy this smart contract A to the network. Then, an exception is raised that does not allow to place A onto the network.","title":"Smart contract message calls chain"},{"location":"wp-and-research/sharding-paper/#incentive-driven-mutual-verification-game-for-safety-and-security","text":"Sharding is usually considered when the system has many participating nodes. This is because higher number of nodes per shard decreases the probability that a shard is colluded meaning that invalid blocks created by a colluded shard can be finalized. In order to make sharding applicable to blockchain systems with smaller number of nodes per shard, i.e. 10 nodes per shard, while still maintaining its security, we propose to use a game theory incentive-driven mechanism which is currently utilized by Plasma. Concretely, a shard is monitored by one or multiple challengers. The latter can be either independent nodes or masternodes in the root chain. They act as full nodes and receive all transactions and blocks processed by the monitored shard and verify all of these blocks. If a processed transaction is detected as invalid, i.e. the transaction is mal-formed or creates money out of thin air, the challenger sends a proof-of-invalidation or fraud proof to the root chain. The incentive for the challenger is that if a transaction is successfully challenged, the challenger gets rewarded as the total deposited tokens of the masternodes that have validated the invalid block. In contrast, all of the masternodes that have verified the invalid block are penalized by losing all of their deposited tokens to the challenger. Note that, non-masternode challengers do not have to deposit any amount of tokens. There are two safety concerns about this incentive-driven approach: Motivation for challengers: Non-masternodes challengers are expected to actively monitor the network to get incentives for invalid blocks. However, in the long term, non-masternodes are only motivated for monitoring the network if there are occasional invalid blocks so that the non-masternodes challengers can compensate for the cost of operating and monitoring the network. If there are no invalid blocks for a long period, the challengers will eventually be discouraged for this monitoring task, thus leaving a safety issue for the attackers in a colluded shard to create invalid blocks. The latter then can be falsely finalized because all non-masternodes challengers turn off their monitoring task since they cannot pay operational costs for monitoring the network. Data availability: Data availability is a strict requirement for the challengers to be able to detect invalidity. Without data, it is impossible to claim fraud proofs. For example, when a new shard block is created, any challenger needs the shard block, the previous state of the shard chain, and the signatures of the attacker masternodes verifying the invalid block, in order to have enough evidence to penalize the attackers. Therefore, all attackers would choose to refuse to broadcast their created blocks to honest nodes. This is because if a shard is colluded, all of the attackers within that shard can finalize an invalid block without sending any block data to honest nodes. We tackle the two aforementioned concerns as follows: Masternode candidates can become challengers to monitor the network and get incentives if some masternodes verify an invalid block. These candidates have incentives to monitor the network to detect the malicious behavior since whether having monitored or not, they still have to pay operational and monitoring costs. Furthermore, monitoring the network is also one of the ways to show its performance for coin-holders to vote it to become a masternode. In addition, if a masternode candidate chooses to not receive shard blocks and later on it is elected as a masternode assigned to a shard, the elected masternode will not be able to verify or create any shard blocks, which in turn lowers its performance. Eventually, the elected masternode will be quickly voted out of the masternode list by the coin-holders. Shard blocks and masternodes\u2019 signatures produced by maternodes need to be propagated to the root chain in order to finalize the blocks. All masternodes then have chance of verifying the validity of the shard blocks to detect the malicious behavior and get incentives. We call this mechanism an incentive-driven mutual verification game. If one shard is colluded and an invalid block is produced by attackers, whether the attackers in the shard want to or not, they have to send the invalid block to the root chain to finalize. Exposing an invalid block to the root chain is extremely risky for the attackers to lose all of their deposits (note that, masternodes are not required to verify blocks submitted to the root chain (that makes computation throughput on the root chain significantly less than the shard chains\u2019). Masternodes can propagate the shard blocks submitted to the root chain to the masternode candidates or any challenger that will verify the validity of the shard blocks, which solves the data availability problem in this case). It is worth noting that, the attackers have no incentives to not propagate invalid blocks to the root chain. This is because, by doing so, the attackers have spent computation resources and operational costs for only locally postponing the transactions within one shard. Furthermore, the attackers will be voted out of the masternode list because of their low performance and these postponed transactions will then be processed by the same shard but with a different set of masternodes once network reshuffling has been executed. Fraud proofs : If a block with an invalid state transition is signed off and propagated throughout the network, any other participant who receives the block can submit a merkleized fraud proof to the Voting smart contract (note that, the Voting smart contract contains all deposits and voted tokens, therefore, the penalty for masternodes creating invalid blocks will be executed by a function within the contract. The penalty function is executed once a fraud proof for an invalid block is submitted by any nodes) on the root chain and the shard chain rejects the invalid block and is rolled back. Fraud proofs ensure that all state transitions are validated. Example fraud proofs are proof of transaction spendability (funds are available in the current shard), proof-of-state transition (including checking the signature for the ability a transaction can be validated and executed, proof of inclusion/exclusion across blocks, and deposit/withdrawal proofs). In order for this construction to have minimal proofs, though, all blocks must provide a commitment to a merkleized trie of the current state, a trie of outputs spent, a merkle tree of transactions, and a reference to the prior state being modified. The fraud proofs and the incentive-driven mutual verification game combined with double validation ensure that a coalition of participants is not able to create invalid blocks that can be finalized without getting penalized. This ensures that the challengers always have access to shard blocks, thus are able to prove (and therefore discourage) invalid state transitions in shard blocks. Compared to TrueBit and Plasma: TrueBit [11] and Plasma [5] both use an incentive-driven verification game approach to provide scalable and secure solutions. Similar to our argument on the incentives for challengers to observe the network, the authors of TrueBit argue that, if there is no chance of finding a bug in the blocks, challengers will likely refuse to continue the monitoring task. In order to motivate the challengers to actively observe the network, TrueBit proposes to provide \u201cforced errors\u201d. These errors are produced at random and unpredictable time. The main objective of blocks with forced errors is to incentivize the challengers and keep them motivated to secure the network. These blocks are special and the creators and validators of these blocks are not penalized. Plasma provides an \u201cexit\u201d mechanism that aims at resolving the data availability problem. Specifically, in Plasma, when a participant cannot access block data of a Plasma chain, the participant can move her asset/token from the Plasma chain to the root chain (or the parent Plasma chain) by executing the \u201cexit\u201d mechanism. The participant then needs to wait for an amount of time, i.e. 1 week, in order for other participants to submit a fraud proof if the exit execution is falsified. In order to maintain fast confirmation time as in the current Tao DPOS design and to have the shards\u2019 liveness, our approach is driven by an incentive and mutual verification game. The latter aims at providing both fast confirmation and detection of Byzantiness of a block. By utilizing the very strong incentivizing-penalizing incentive-driven mutual verification game, challengers are strongly encouraged to work hard in order to keep the system safe and secure and shard masternodes are discouraged to act maliciously.","title":"Incentive-driven Mutual Verification Game for Safety and Security"},{"location":"wp-and-research/sharding-paper/#reshuffling-and-data-availability","text":"To enhance further the security of shards, it is very important that shards should be dynamic for resilience against attacks and failures of nodes in a shard. For example, one shard might be stuck in a situation where blocks are valid but cannot be finalized because attacking masternodes do not validate these blocks. A technique for dealing with this problem is to reshuffle the masternodes assigned to the shards. This means the set of masternodes for each shard is changed dynamically every epoch. At the end of each epoch, the randomization sampling is repeated for a different set of masternodes elected to participate into shards. Reshuffling enhances the security and resilience of the system. However, it introduces a new challenge: the data availability problem. In the latter, every masternode joining to a new shard must synchronize the blockchain portion of this new shard in order to be able to verify transactions belonging to it. If the portion is too large and the synchronization time is too short, the entire shard cannot verify any transaction, thus renders the shard useless for the whole synchronization time. This problem can be tackled by the following strategies:: Shard masternodes storing all states of other shards: It requires that all masternodes, even non-shard member nodes, must receive and store all of the portions of state in all shards. This solution allows for any masternodes to smoothly switch from one shard to or join any other shard without needing a data synchronization time. Gradual reshuffling: Instead of resampling the whole set of masternodes assigned to each shard at the end of each epoch, the reshuffling might only pull a subset of masternodes out of a shard while leaving the remainder intact, i.e. 1/10 of the masternodes are kicked out from a shard while the other masternodes still stay in the shard and the resampling takes c/10 (c is the shard size) masternodes randomly from the set of masternode candidates. Since the latter have been synchronizing all blocks (see Section IV for more information), the system can smoothly continue the operations without interrupting time for data synchronization. Randomization sampling in advance: Still using the strategy of giving masternodes joining new shards some amount of time to download the blockchain data of a shard, this approach lets the network execute the randomization sampling in the middle of an epoch. Therefore, assigned masternodes will know ahead of time to which shard they will contribute in the next epoch. In this fashion, these in-advance assigned masternodes will have enough time to download the blockchain data of the assigned shard to prepare for the next epoch. Currently, we have been leaning towards the first and second strategy because these solutions are more implementable and analyzable for security. These strategies will be rigorously analyzed before making a final decision since both have its own advantages and limitations. While the first strategy has advantage of simplicity and masternodes and candidates can switch from one shard to any other shard smoothly, the storage and network bandwidth of masternodes might be more needed. On the other hand, the second strategy can save more storage and network bandwidth, it raises a question: which masternodes should be kicked out of a shard if the performance of all masternodes in that shard is efficiently equal to each other\u2019s.","title":"Reshuffling and Data Availability"},{"location":"wp-and-research/sharding-paper/#conclusion","text":"The paper has presented a new solution to sharding architecture for public blockchains.

The proposed solution uses the Proof-of-Stake Voting (DPOS) efficient consensus protocol proposed by Tao for intra-shard consensus.

The vast experience we have gained serving the interests of the music industry have crystalized the technological requirements of a cryptocurrency which may truly begin to disrupt the power structures which dominate the landscape. A platform which would enable a \u201cDeFi for music\u201d brings with it not only a set of technological prerequisites, but consensus must remain true to the ethics and ideals of the music industry we have come to serve. It is towards these noble ends that we are creating the means to manifest that future: Tao2. Introduction \u00b6 The blockchain industry and the infrastructure of the Internet of Value are being built rapidly around the globe, and to many the atmosphere is eerily similar to the building of the Internet in the late \u201890s, with pioneers and dreamers coming together to build a new future. Tao is the first blockchain platform which has dedicated its focus to leveraging the latest of blockchain technologies towards a more democratized, egalitarian future for the music economy. This upgrade shall acheive this vision through seamlessly merging an ecosystem of applications with cryptographic tokens used by millions of mainstream users with a unique blockchain infrastructure architecture allowing for a fast, secure, frictionless payment and trusted store of value. The distributed systems which currently dominate the music economy have been researched in a \u201c permissioned setting \u201d where the number of participants in the system and their identities are common knowledge. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto - \u201cproposed his celebrated \u201cblockchain protocol\u201d which attempts to achieve consensus in a permissionless setting: anyone can join (or leave) the protocol execution (without getting permission from a centralized or distributed authority), and the protocol instructions do not depend on the identities of the players\u201d (see here ). Later on, Ethereum with its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) proposed several significant enhancements compared to Bitcoin, including Smart Contracts. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have some issues, especially with transaction processing performance. In order to construct an efficient and secured consensus protocol for Tao , we tackle the following main bottlenecks of classic blockchains: - Efficiency: Existing blockchains as employed by major cryptocurrencies(e.g., Tao 1.0 or Ethereum) do not scale well to handle a large transaction volume, e.g. Tao 1.0 and Ethereum can handle around 7-10 transactions/second. - Confirmation times: The original Tao blockchain took 7.5 minutes per block, and is significantly larger than network latency. Furthermore, a Tao 1.0 block requires 10 subsequent blocks following it so that it can be confirmed; thus it takes on average 1.5 hours for a transaction to be confirmed (with low confidence). While Ethereum uses a shorter block-time, the average confirmation time still remains relatively high, around 13 minutes Cardano . These long confirmation times hinder many important applications (especially smart contract applications). - Unwanted Fork Potential: The problem of fork chain consumes computational energy, time, and creates potential vulnerabilities for different types of attacks. - Trust While the systems are trustless, those who create them are not. As a result, existing music economy stakeholders from across the spectrum have rejected those platforms such as Ethereum for anything more than experimental use. The Tao project began life in 2015 by directly engaging the most significant music industry stakeholders in order to gain their input as to the pain points present in their industry with the goal of potentially solving them with blockchain technology. The Tao 1.0 cryptocurrency was launched in 2016 based on these conversations with specific features which were desired by the music industry: - Proof of Stake Allowing for artists, producers, and labels to participate in network consensus - Masternodes Allowing for the instant settlement of transactions and enhancing Layer 1 consensus - Tokenization Allowing for the digital representation of paper contracts as well as advanced automation - Community \u2013 Providing clear focus and dedication to serving the needs of the music industry, while directly engaging fans and artists alike While these goals were achieved, certain other important aspects of cryptocurrency adoption were neglected. - Market traction Listings on multiple exchanges - Technological modernization Keeping in line with the latest in cryptocurrency and blockchain developments - Developer support Missing tools which would allow developers to create applications using the blockchain With these lessons now learned, the Tao cryptocurrency protocol will be upgraded to a protocol known as \u201cTao 2.0\u201d or \u201cTao2\". This document delves into the specifics of Tao2, including its consensus mechanisms, operational performance, and technological features: - Random Generals to reduce the proof of stake attack surface, increase data reliability, and reduce fork potential - Additional randomization to guarantee fairness and prevent handshaking and Sybil attacks - Fast confirmation time and efficient, decentralized checkpoints for transaction finality and minimal potential rebase To start dealing with these problems, in this paper, we present an overview architectural design of Tao \u2019s masternode design called \"Shifu\". In particular, we propose Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS)-based blockchain protocol with a fair voting mechanism, rigorous security guarantees and fast finality. This presents a novel reward mechanism which, with this mechanism, the blockchain has a low probability of forks, fast confirmation times, plus the contributions and benefits of masternodes are fair in the sense that the division of rewards is a fair probabilstic computation. Structure of the remainder of the paper \u00b6 Section Shifu Protocol (Masternode) Design : explains the intuition ideas and overview architectural design of the Delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, framework and background protocols that help mass readers (e.g., investors, traders, others) who may not have technical knowledge understand our mechanism easily. Section Stakeholders, Delegates, & Voting presents Tao stakeholder policy, masternode candidate delegate voting systems, and reward mechanism. Section Tao consensus protocol explains the motivation and Random Generals process as well as finality checkpoint of the protocol. In Section Protocol formalizations , we present the formalization of our model in a mathematical way to show the soundness of our model and protocol. Section Security Analysis discusses the security analysis and resistant strain of potential attacks. We discuss and compare Tao with several existing blockchains in Section related work . Finally, we conclude the paper in Section Conclusion . Shifu Protocol (Masternode) Design \u00b6 Tao architecture \u00b6 The Tao blockchain is produced and maintained by a set of masternodes in a consistent manner through the Tao consensus protocol as shown in Fig. architecture . These masternodes are full nodes which operate an Etherem Virtual Machine (EVM). For a token holder to become a masternode, two requirements must be satisfied: - The token holder must hold at least a minimum required amount of tokens (see next section for more details). - The token holder must be one of the most voted masternode candidates in the system. The voting by token holders is credited through a Voting DApp that allows token holders to send TAO as a Delegate through the smart contract mechanism . In addition to the voting system which is an improvement over the current Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain consensus mechanisms, Tao also provides a new technique, Random Generals . This new technique significantly decreases the probability of having invalid blocks in the blockchain, dramatically reducing the overall attack surface. These enhancements and the components of Tao are step-by-step detailed in the followings. Stakeholders & Voting \u00b6 Token holders, Masternodes \u00b6 Token holder is as simple as its name: users who join the network, who own and transfer TAO. Masternodes are full-nodes which maintain a copy of the blockchain, produce blocks and keep the chain consistent. It is worth noting that Tao is an extremely energy efficient cryptocurrency platform, as it does not use costly dedicated mining equiment as is required by Proof-of-Work-based blockchain systems. Only masternodes can produce and validate blocks, and in a mechanism known as Delegated Proof of Stake. Masternodes are selected via where token holders vote for block producers via an amount of TAO called a Delegate. The first requirement of being masternodes is to deposit 100,000TAO to the Voting Smart Contract. These depositors are listed as masternode candidates in the Voting DApp, which allows token holders to vote for them by sending a Delegate to the smart contract in the name of that masternode. Masternodes which process valid states to create and verify blocks will be incentivized with TAO. Furthermore, token holders who vote for these incentivized masternodes will also receive TAO in proportion to the amount of their Delegate. The list of masternode candidates is dynamically sorted based on Delegate counts. The performance of the masternodes will be tracked and reported back to the token holders in terms of three main metrics: CPU/Memory charts which ensure the workload of the masternodes, the number of signed blocks which indicates their work performance, and the last signed block which figures out their last activity. Token holders, at any time, can unvote masternodes, who have low performance, and provide their Delegates to the other masternodes which display superior performance. As lower performing masternodes lose Delegates, they will eventually denied the ability to create and sign new blocks. This mechanism keeps the system healthy and scalable as masternodes must always outperform their peers to maintain a superior production rate and thereby earn the most TAO. Therefore, only the strongest masternodes are voted and can flourish. Voting & Masternode Pool \u00b6 There are maximum one hundred fifty (150) masternodes elected in the masternode pool. The required amount of deposit for masternode role is set at 100,000TAO. This amount is locked in a voting smart contract . Once a masternode is demoted (by not remaining in the top one hundred fifty voted masternodes) or intentionally quits the masternode candidates list/masternode pool, the deposit will have been locked for a month. Token holders can vote at any time, by any number of votes (which is actually counted by the amount of TAO they bet on some masternode candidates). They can use masternode\u2019s performance statistics in the governance Voting DApp as reference information to give votes. The set of masternodes is dynamically sorted by the amount of TAO and counted up to one hundred fifty, upon reception of votes. Reward Mechanism \u00b6 For each iteration of 900 blocks (called epoch), a checkpoint block is created, which implements only reward works. The masternode, who takes turn in the circular and sequential order to create blocks, has to scan all of the created blocks in the epoch and count number of signatures. The reward mechanism is designed following the policy as follows: the higher number of signatures one masternode has made, the more reward he earns. For instance, within an epoch, masternode A who has sealed twice the blocks than masternode B earns double amount of TAO than masternode B does. Furthermore, there is also a reward sharing ratio among token holders and masternode who has been elected supported by the token holders. Specifically, each epoch consists of 900 blocks, which will reward a total of 250 TAO in the first two years. This amount of 250 TAO will be divided to all of the Masternodes proportionally to the number of signatures they sign during the epoch. Afterward, the reward achieved by each Masternode will be divided into three portions. - Infrastructure Reward : The first portion of 40% called Infrastructure Reward goes to the Masternode. Staking Reward : The second portion of 50% called Staking Reward goes to the pool of all voters for that Masternode which is shared proportionally based on the token stake. Foundation Reward : The last portion of 10% called Foundation Reward goes to a special account controlled by the Masternode Foundation, which is run by Tao company initially. It is worth noting that coin-holders who unvote before the checkpoint block will not receive any shared reward in the Staking Reward portion. Tao Consensus Protocol \u00b6 Random Generals Process \u00b6 In Tao, masternodes share equal responsibility to run the system and keep it stable. Full nodes should run on powerful hardware configuration and high-speed network connectivity in order to ensure the required block time (target to two seconds). Only masternodes can produce and seal blocks. In order for that, the Tao consensus relies on the concept of Random Generals that improves some existing consensus mechanisms, namely Single Validation . In the followings, we first describe the Random Generals , then analyze the differences and improvements of Random Generals compared to Single Validation . Random Generals (DV) \u00b6 Similar to some existing PoS-based blockchains such as Cardano , each block is created by a block producer, namely masternode, that takes its block creation permission turn following a pre-determined and circular sequence of masternodes for each epoch. However, differently from these existing blockchains, DV in Tao requires the signatures of two masternodes on a block to be able to push the block to the blockchain. One of the masternodes is the block creator while the other one, namely block verifier is randomly selected among the set of voted masternodes that validates the block and signs it. In the followings, for more convenience, block creator and block verifier are used interchangeably for the masternode 1 (block producer) and the randomly selected masternode 2 for a block, respectively. The process of randomly selecting the block verifiers is detailed in the next paragraphs. Note that, there is no mining in the block creation as in Proof-of-Work-based blockchains (e.g. Ethereum and Bitcoin). It means that a created block is valid if and only if it is sealed by enough two signatures from a block creator and a corresponding block verifier to confirm the correctness of it. We believe this DV technique enhances the stability of the blockchain by diminishing the probability of producing \u201cgarbage\u201d blocks while still maintaining the system security and consistency. Randomization of block verifiers in DV is the key factor of reducing risks coming from paired masternodes trying to commit malicious blocks. Furthermore, comparing to some current public blockchains in the market, by utilizing the DV technique, Tao brings significant improvements in the block time by only requiring two signatures per block. For the purpose of showing our enhancement over existing PoS-based blockchains, we analyze the differences between DV and the Single Validation mechanism in some existing blockchains as follows. Improvements of Random Generals over Single Validation \u00b6 Let\u2019s show the improvements of DV compared to Single Validation through analyzing some attacking scenarios as shown in Fig. Single Validation example and Fig. Random Generals example . Single Validation In Single Validation, in an epoch, each masternode, e.g. M1, sequentially takes its turn to create a block, e.g. block100. The next masternode, e.g. M2, in the sequence then validates the created block100. If block100 is invalid (that potentially means that M1 is an attacker) and contains a transaction that invalidly benefits M1, if M2 is honest (see Fig. SV a ), it rejects block100 and creates another block100 next to block99. But, if M2 is an attacker (see Fig. SV b ) that corporates with M1, M2 ignores the invalidation of block100, signs it and creates next block, namely block101 that is valid. Then, the next masternode M3 verifies that block101 is valid, M3 signs block101 and creates a block102. By this way, Single Validation potentially leaves the blockchain with \u201cgarbage\u201d or invalid blocks which require a \u201crebase\u201d to restore the validity of the blockchain. Single Validation (SV): (a) SV with block creation masternode as an attacker and (b) SV with two consecutive block creation masternodes as attackers Random Generals We claim that our DV technique significantly reduces the probability of having garbage blocks in the blockchain. Assuming that M1 and M2 are the block creator and block verifier, respectively, for block100 in our DV. If block100 is invalid and M2 is honest (see Fig. DV a ), M2 will not seal this block. Therefore, the next block creator M3 for creating block101 will see that block100 does not have enough 2 signatures, thus reject block100 and create another block100 next to block99. On the other hand, if M2 is also an attacker pairing/handshaking with M1 (see Fig. DV b ), M2 signs block100 despite its invalidity (remember that the block verifier M2 is randomly selected, there has little chance of successfully pairing M1 and M2). Next, even though M3 will verify that block100 has two valid signatures, M3 still rejects it because block100 is invalidated by M3 that will create another valid block100. In order to break the stability and consistency of the blockchain in this case, M3 should be an attacker together with M1 and M2, which, however, has a very low probability. In other words, DV strengthens the consistency of the blockchain and makes it hard to break. Random Generals (DV): (a) DV with block creator as an attacker and (b) DV with both block creator and block verifier as attackers Randomization for Block Verifiers for Random Generals \u00b6 The First Masternode/Block Creator \u00b6 The first masternode/block creator in a given epoch e can be selected by a round-turn game and can be formal defined as an array: \\begin{bmatrix} \\nu_1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} V_{1.1}^e \\\\ V_{1.2}^e\\\\ \\cdot\\\\ \\cdot\\\\ \\cdot\\\\ V_{1.n-1}^e\\\\ V_{1.n}^e\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} Random Matrix and Smart Contract \u00b6 Let m be the number of masternodes, n be the number of slots in an epoch. In order to randomly generate the block verifiers for the next epoch e+1 , the process is performed by the following steps. Step 1: Random Numbers Generation and Commitment Phase: First, at the beginning of epoch e , each masternode V_i will securely create an array of n+1 special random numbers Recommend_i= [ r_{i.1}, r_{i.2}, ..., r_{i.n}, \\theta_i] , where r_{i.k}\\in [1, ..., m] indicating the recommendation of ordered list of block verifiers for the next epoch of V_i , and \\theta_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\} is used for increasing the unpredictability of the random numbers. Second, each masternode V_i has to encrypt the array Recommend_i using a secret key SK_i , say Secret_i = Encrypt (Recommend_i, SK_i) . Next, each masternode forms a \" lock \u201d message that contains encrypted secret array Secret_i ; signs off this message with its blockchain\u2019s private key through the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) scheme currently used in Ethereum and Bitcoin along with the corresponding epoch index and its public key generated from its private key. By doing this, every masternode can check who created this lock message through ECDSA verification scheme and which epoch it relates to. Then, each node V_i sends their lock message with its signature and public key to a Smart contract stored in the blockchain, so that eventually each masternode collects and knows the lock s from all other masternodes. Step 2: Discovery and Recovery Phase: The recovery phase is for every node to reveal its previous lock message so that other nodes can get to know the secret array it has sent before. A masternode only starts revealing its lock message if all masternodes have sent their lock messages to the smart contract or a certain timeout event occurs. Each masternode then opens its lock message by sending an \u201d unlock \u201d message to the smart contract for other masternodes to open the corresponding lock. Imagine a commitment-like scheme in this case where a lock message is a commitment message locking its contained recommendation array Recommend_i (so that no one can open or guess the contained array), and the unlock message gives the key for other masternodes to decrypt the box and retrieve the values of Recommend_i . Eventually, a masternode has both locks and unlocks of others. If some elector is an adversary which might publish its lock but not intend to send the corresponding unlock, other masternodes can ignore the adversary\u2019s lock and set all its random values be 1 as default. The idea is simple: the network can keep working successfully even if some masternodes are adversaries. Step 3: Assembled Matrix and Computation Phase: At the point of the slot n^{th} of the epoch e , the secret arrays Secret_I in the smart contract will be decrypted by each masternode and return the plain version of Recommend_i . Each tuple of the first n numbers of each V_i will be assembled as the i^{th} column of an n \\times m matrix. All the last number \\theta_i forms a m\\times 1 matrix. Then each nodes will compute the block verifiers ordered list by some mathematical operations as explained below. The resulting output is a matrix n \\times 1 indicating the order of block verifiers for the next epoch e+1 . The Second Masternode/Block Verifier \u00b6 Then, each node soon compute the common array \\nu_2 for the order of the block verifiers by the following steps as in the upper equation as belows. Then, \\nu_2 is obtained by modulo operation of element values of \\nu'_2 as in the lower equation in the followings: \\label{eq:matrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\nu'_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_{2.1}^{e+1} \\\\ v_{2.2}^{e+1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{2.n}^{e+1} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} r_{1.1} & r_{2.1} & \\cdots & r_{m.1} \\\\ r_{1.2} & r_{2.2} & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ r_{1.3} & \\ddots & \\ddots & r_{m.3} \\\\ \\vdots & & r_{m-1.n-1} & r_{m.n-1} \\\\ r_{1.n} & \\cdots & r_{m-1.n} & r_{m.n} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\\\ \\theta_3 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\theta_m \\end{bmatrix} \\label{eq:eq2} \\begin{bmatrix} \\nu_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\nu'_2 & mod & m \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\left| v_{2.1}^{e+1}\\right| & mod & m \\\\ \\left| v_{2.2}^{e+1} \\right| & mod & m\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\left| v_{2.n}^{e+1} \\right| & mod & m \\end{bmatrix} Finality Analysis \u00b6 \"There is a standard definition of \u201ctotal economic finality\u201d: it takes place when \\frac{3}{4} of all masternodes make maximum-odds bets that a given block or state will be finalized. This condition offers very strong incentives for masternodes to never try colluding revert the block: once masternodes make such maximum-odds bets, in any blockchain where that block or state is not present, the masternodes lose their entire deposit\" (see here . Tao keeps that standardization in the design so that one block is considered as irreversible if it collects at least \\frac{3}{4} signatures of all masternodes pool. The time-line of blockchain creation process, checking finality and mark the block as immutable is described as in Figure: ChainMaking below. Consensus Protocol: Formalization \u00b6 Basic Concepts & Protocol Description \u00b6 In order to have a solid foundation for us to prove that our blockchain can achieve what are claimed, we first present our preliminary formalizations of the concepts that will be used in our yellow paper later. To start, as we are dealing with proof of stake consensus algorithm, we follow the way of formalization in the recent works in the literature like Cardano and here and here here . In particular, we recall the following concepts and definitions that were presented in Cardano and adapt them to the context of Tao. Time, Slots, Epoch \u00b6 As previously described, ideally, each epoch is divided into 900 block time, that is called block slot. Only one block can be created in a slot. We assume that there is a roughly synchronized clock that allows for masternodes to learn the current slot. This simplification will effectively permit masternodes to execute the signing and validation process of the DPOS consensus, where each masternode must collectively create a block to the current slot. For more simplification, each slot sl_r is accessed by an integer r \\in \\{1, 2, ...900\\} , and suppose that the real time window that corresponds to each slot has the following properties, which are similar to what are specified in Cardano . Every masternode can determine the index of the current slot based on the current time and \u201dany discrepancies between parties\u2019 local time are insignificant in comparison with the length of time represented by a slot\u201d Cardano The amount of a slot time is sufficient to guarantee that any message transmitted by an honest party at the beginning of the time window will be received by any other honest party by the end of that time window. While this assumption similar to Cardano , Tao requires it in order for a block creator to propagate its created block to the corresponding block verifier to ensure that the block is signed by both the masternodes before the next block creator builds another block on top of it. As mentioned in Section TaoOverview , in our setting, we assume that the fixed collection of m (150) masternodes V_1, V_2, ...., V_m interact throughout the protocol. For each V_i a public/private key pair ( pk_i , sk_i ) for a prescribed signature scheme, ideally ECDSA, is generated. Furthermore, we assume that the public keys pk_1 ,.., pk_m of the masternodes are distributed and known by all of them (that means a masternode knows all public keys of other nodes). Some notable definitions of the blockchain concepts are defined following the notation in here . State A state (defined as in here ) is an encoded string st \\in \\{0,1\\}^\\lambda . Block A block (defined as in here ) B generated at a slot sl_i \\in \\{sl_1,...,sl_R\\} contains the current state st \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{\\lambda} , data d \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{*} , the slot number sl_i and a signature \\Sigma = Sign_{ski} (st, d, sl_i) computed under sk_i corresponding to the masternode V_i generating the block. Blockchain A blockchain (defined as in here ) C is a sequence of blocks B_1,..., B_n associated with a strictly increasing sequence of slots for which the state sti of B_i is equal to H(B_{i\u22121}) , where H is a collision-resistant cryptography hash function. A blockchain has a number of properties, including the length of a chain len(C) = n , which is its number of blocks, and the block B_n is the head of the chain, denoted head(C) . As mentioned earlier, in our Tao model, we set each time slot sl_i as 2 seconds; an epoch is a set R of 900 slots \\{ sl_1, sl_2, ..., sl_{900}\\} (an epoch time duration equals to 1800 seconds). In summary, the consensus protocol of Tao can be formalized in Algorithm ValidatorGeneration. The Algorithm ValidatorGeneration is simulated and explained as a process shown in Fig. EpochProcess . Security Analysis \u00b6 Nothing-at-stake \u00b6 Nothing-at-stake is a well-known problem in PoS-based blockchain, just like 51% attack in PoW algorithm. PoW-based miners require CapEx (capital expenditures) for buying mining equipment such as ASICs and OpEx (operation expenditures) such as electricity to solve mathematical puzzles securing the network (see here ). That means, there is always an intrinsic cost for miners in mining regardless of its success. In case of a fork, miners therefore always allocate their resource (equipment) to the chain that they believe is correct in order to get incentives for compensating the intrinsic costs in mining. In the contrary, in PoS-based systems without mining, during an ideal execution, for creating a fork only costs, masternodes actually do not incur intrinsic costs, other than roughly some block validation and signing cost. As a result, there\u2019s an inherent problem of the masternode having no downside to staking both forks. Therefore, there are actually two issues in the original design of PoS. On one hand, for any masternode, the optimal strategy is to validate every chain/fork, so that the masternode gets their rewards no matter which fork wins. On the other hand, for attackers/malicious masternodes, they can easily create a fork for double spending. Let\u2019s look back how Tao handles these two problems. As a reminder, Tao maintains a certain order of masternodes in creating and sealing blocks, in each epoch. For the first issue, random/arbitrary forks are hardly happened because the order of block creation masternodes is pre-determined for each epoch. Furthermore, the Random Generals mechanism eliminates the second issue because even one malicious masternode creates two blocks at his turn, only one block then can be validated by the second randomly selected masternode. Long-range attack \u00b6 In Tao , block is valid only if it collects double validation and finalized once \\frac{3}{4} of masternodes verify. Therefore, as long as the number of attackers or malicious nodes and/or fail-stop nodes is less equal than \\frac{1}{4} the number of masternodes, the number of masternodes signing a block is at least \\frac{3}{4} the total number of masternodes, which makes the block finalized. Thus, there is no chance for one malicious masternode to create longer valid chain because other masternodes will refuse it. Censorship Attack \u00b6 If there are more than \\frac{3}{4} malicious masternodes in Tao , censorship attack might happen. For example, these masternodes refuse valid blocks or simply become inactive. In this case, chain is stuck. In fact, masternodes are paid for their effort of correctly working so that the chain is actively updated in a consistent manner. More importantly, becoming masternode means a certain amount of tokens is locked, 50 000 TAO in particular. As a result, in order to control more than \\frac{3}{4} masternodes, attackers must hold a considerable amount of TAO and gain huge support from token holders. And because of this, the attackers do not have incentives to do any malicious action to harm the chain. However, in worst case, Tao has to do a soft fork in order to reduce number of masternodes to keep the chain running and figure out slasher mechanisms for those malicious masternodes. Relay Attack \u00b6 Tao supports EIP155 Transactions in Tao are included CHAIN\\_ID specified for different public chains. Table table:chainid shows recognized CHAIN\\_ID s. CHAIN_ID Chain(s) 1 Ethereum mainnet 2 Morden (disused), Expanse mainnet 3 Ropsten 4 Rinkeby 30 Rootstock mainnet 31 Rockstock testnet 42 Kovan 61 Ethereum Classic mainnet 62 Ethereum Classic testnet 1337 Geth private chains (default) 77 Sokol, the public POA Network testnet 99 Core, the public POA Network main network 88 Mainnet 89 Testnet Safety and liveness \u00b6 Safety implies having a single agreed upon chain where there are not two or more competing chains with valid transactions in either (see here . A consensus protocol can be safe when blocks have settlement finality, or else probabilistic finality. This last sentence reveals that can provide safety because it has a settlement finality. A consensus protocol is considered live if it can eventually propagate and make valid transactions onto the blockchain (see here . An occurrence of a liveness fault is when transaction omission, information withholding, or message reordering, among a number of violations are observed. This type of fault is unlikely to happen in Tao because the block creation masternodes list is ordered in a pre-determined way for each epoch, thus if even an attacking masternode omits some transactions, the latter will be processed and validated by the next honest masternode in the next block. DDOS Attack \u00b6 Masternodes are encouraged to run in well-known public cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure which provides multiple DDOS prevention mechanisms. Even in case that some nodes are attacked or fail-stop, the network still works correctly as long as the number of failing and/or attacked nodes is less than 1/4 of the number of masternodes. Spam Attack \u00b6 Tao keeps the same transaction fee mechanism as Ethereum which is indicated via gasPrice. However, Tao supports minimum transaction fee (at 1 wei), which somehow enables spamming that attacker tries to broadcast a huge amount of low fee transactions to the system. However, Tao masternodes always sort transactions and pick up only high fee transactions into the proposing block. Thus, spammers have little chance to harm the system. Related work \u00b6 Consensus plays an important role to guarantee the success of distributed and decentralized systems. Bitcoin\u2019s core consensus protocol, often referred to as Nakamoto consensus Bitcoin , realizes a \u201creplicated state machine\u201d abstraction, where nodes in a permissionless network reach agreement about a set of transactions committed as well as their ordering (see here . However, known permissionless consensus protocols such as Bitcoin\u2019s Nakamoto consensus come at a cost. Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on PoW to roughly enforce the idea of \u201cone vote per hashpower\u201d and to defend against Sybil attacks. Unfortunately, PoW-based Bitcoin and Ethereum are known to have terrible performance (Bitcoin\u2019s transaction processing performance is at peak of around 7 transactions per second as previously mentioned). Moreover, PoW is much criticized because it costs a lot of electricity energy. In order to design an efficient and cost-effective consensus protocol in the permissionless model, PoS has been discussed extensively in the Bitcoin and Ethereum forum . A PoS blockchain can substitute the costly PoW in Nakamoto\u2019s blockchain while still providing similar guarantees in terms of transaction processing in the presence of a dishonest minority of users, where this \u201cminority\u201d is to be understood here in the context of stake rather than computational power Cardano . The Ethereum design Casper , published by Buterin & Griffith, provides as its initial version a PoW/PoS hybrid consensus protocol, which might eventually switch to a pure PoS system. As in Tao , Ethereum Casper requires that validators (term similar to block creators) have to deposit an amount. In fact, some concepts used in Tao such as checkpoint blocks are borrowed from Casper. Our (DPOS) consensus protocol proposed in this paper can be seen as a hybrid model. In particular, first, we apply with voting and Random Generals to create, verify and vote for blocks smoothly and efficiently. Whenever potentials of fork branches are detected, we employ the idea in PoW to select the longest branch with the most votes and discard the other branches. This hybrid approach not only increases the performance and security of blockchain, but also reduces the fork situation in an efficient and practical manner. Recently, there are several consensus protocol research works that are closely related to Tao such as EOS and Ouroboros of Cardano . The mechanism of voting for masternodes for reaching consensus is utilized by Bitshares and EOS , whose consensus protocol is termed Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). DPoS is similar to the Proof-of-Stake Voting consensus of Tao in the sense that masternodes (block creators or witnesses in DPoS) are elected through a voting system. However, Tao requires that masternodes need to deposit a required minimum amount of TAO to become a masternode candidate, which puts more pressure on the masternodes to work honestly. Furthermore, the Random Generals mechanism of Tao lowers the probability of handshaking attacks and having invalid blocks, as previously analyzed. EOS also has a maximum of 21 block producers for each epoch, which is less decentralized than Tao with a maximum of 150 masternodes elected (and this number of masternodes can be changed following the decentralized governance through voting). The research-backed Cardano blockchain solution, namely Ouroboros, with the ADA coin, which is purely based on Proof-of-Stake, promisingly claims to provide rigorous security guarantees. Similarly to Tao , Ouroboros has a set of block producers for each epoch for creating blocks and each block producer candidate needs to deposit a minimum amount of stake (an amount of ADA). However, note that, Ouroboros only provides Single Validation , while Random Generals of Tao provides several advantages over Single Validation, as previously analyzed. In Ouroboros, the order of block producers, selected among stakers, is based on a biased randomization while the Tao \u2019s randomization for block verifiers is potentially uniform and based on smart contracts. Furthermore, the use of voting as in Tao and DPoS enables a more incentive equality between stakers: In Ouroboros, stakers with very little stake have a very small probability of becoming block creators, while, in Tao , these stakers can choose an optimal strategy to vote for potential masternodes to get incentives. Conclusion and perspectives \u00b6 In this paper, we proposed DPOS, a PoS Voting-based blockchain protocol with heuristic and fair voting mechanism, rigorous security guarantees, and fast finality. We also presented a novel reward mechanism and show that, with this mechanism, the blockchain has a low probability of having forks, fast confirmation time, plus the contributions and benefits of masternodes are fair in the sense that the probability distribution function is uniform eventually. Perspectives \u00b6 Future work The Tao team is currently working on the implementation of the Proof-of-Stake Voting, which will be released on schedule as stated in our roadmap. Furthermore, in parallel with our novel consensus protocol, we will investigate the Sharding mechanism in order to provide even better transaction processing performance. We believe that, the Sharding technique with the stable number of masternodes will provide better stability and efficiency to the blockchain. At the same time, we commit to keep EVM-compatible smart contracts within our masternode sharding framework. Economic sustainability is also an important concept for a blockchain based decentralized network. That means to maintain the network in a sustainable condition, an equilibrium needs to be achieved, in which the cost of running the network infrastructure could be offset by the revenues generated. In this context, the cost of network infrastructure consists of two parts: the physical cost of having hardware such as servers, memories that passes the network technical requirements; and the capital cost of having TAO locked into smart-contracts. The revenues for Masternodes would primarily come from Reward Engine emission, and later on from service revenues such as token exchange fees provided by applications running on top of Tao. We will publish a Tao economic analysis and proposal, separate from this technical paper in a later date. References \u00b6 Satoshi Nakamoto.

Tao is the first blockchain platform which has dedicated its focus to leveraging the latest of blockchain technologies towards a more democratized, egalitarian future for the music economy. This upgrade shall acheive this vision through seamlessly merging an ecosystem of applications with cryptographic tokens used by millions of mainstream users with a unique blockchain infrastructure architecture allowing for a fast, secure, frictionless payment and trusted store of value. The distributed systems which currently dominate the music economy have been researched in a \u201c permissioned setting \u201d where the number of participants in the system and their identities are common knowledge. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto - \u201cproposed his celebrated \u201cblockchain protocol\u201d which attempts to achieve consensus in a permissionless setting: anyone can join (or leave) the protocol execution (without getting permission from a centralized or distributed authority), and the protocol instructions do not depend on the identities of the players\u201d (see here ). Later on, Ethereum with its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) proposed several significant enhancements compared to Bitcoin, including Smart Contracts. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have some issues, especially with transaction processing performance. In order to construct an efficient and secured consensus protocol for Tao , we tackle the following main bottlenecks of classic blockchains: - Efficiency: Existing blockchains as employed by major cryptocurrencies(e.g., Tao 1.0 or Ethereum) do not scale well to handle a large transaction volume, e.g. Tao 1.0 and Ethereum can handle around 7-10 transactions/second. - Confirmation times: The original Tao blockchain took 7.5 minutes per block, and is significantly larger than network latency. Furthermore, a Tao 1.0 block requires 10 subsequent blocks following it so that it can be confirmed; thus it takes on average 1.5 hours for a transaction to be confirmed (with low confidence). While Ethereum uses a shorter block-time, the average confirmation time still remains relatively high, around 13 minutes Cardano . These long confirmation times hinder many important applications (especially smart contract applications). - Unwanted Fork Potential: The problem of fork chain consumes computational energy, time, and creates potential vulnerabilities for different types of attacks. - Trust While the systems are trustless, those who create them are not. As a result, existing music economy stakeholders from across the spectrum have rejected those platforms such as Ethereum for anything more than experimental use. The Tao project began life in 2015 by directly engaging the most significant music industry stakeholders in order to gain their input as to the pain points present in their industry with the goal of potentially solving them with blockchain technology. The Tao 1.0 cryptocurrency was launched in 2016 based on these conversations with specific features which were desired by the music industry: - Proof of Stake Allowing for artists, producers, and labels to participate in network consensus - Masternodes Allowing for the instant settlement of transactions and enhancing Layer 1 consensus - Tokenization Allowing for the digital representation of paper contracts as well as advanced automation - Community \u2013 Providing clear focus and dedication to serving the needs of the music industry, while directly engaging fans and artists alike While these goals were achieved, certain other important aspects of cryptocurrency adoption were neglected. - Market traction Listings on multiple exchanges - Technological modernization Keeping in line with the latest in cryptocurrency and blockchain developments - Developer support Missing tools which would allow developers to create applications using the blockchain With these lessons now learned, the Tao cryptocurrency protocol will be upgraded to a protocol known as \u201cTao 2.0\u201d or \u201cTao2\". This document delves into the specifics of Tao2, including its consensus mechanisms, operational performance, and technological features: - Random Generals to reduce the proof of stake attack surface, increase data reliability, and reduce fork potential - Additional randomization to guarantee fairness and prevent handshaking and Sybil attacks - Fast confirmation time and efficient, decentralized checkpoints for transaction finality and minimal potential rebase To start dealing with these problems, in this paper, we present an overview architectural design of Tao \u2019s masternode design called \"Shifu\". In particular, we propose Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS)-based blockchain protocol with a fair voting mechanism, rigorous security guarantees and fast finality. This presents a novel reward mechanism which, with this mechanism, the blockchain has a low probability of forks, fast confirmation times, plus the contributions and benefits of masternodes are fair in the sense that the division of rewards is a fair probabilstic computation.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/#structure-of-the-remainder-of-the-paper","text":"Section Shifu Protocol (Masternode) Design : explains the intuition ideas and overview architectural design of the Delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, framework and background protocols that help mass readers (e.g., investors, traders, others) who may not have technical knowledge understand our mechanism easily.

These masternodes are full nodes which operate an Etherem Virtual Machine (EVM). For a token holder to become a masternode, two requirements must be satisfied: - The token holder must hold at least a minimum required amount of tokens (see next section for more details). - The token holder must be one of the most voted masternode candidates in the system. The voting by token holders is credited through a Voting DApp that allows token holders to send TAO as a Delegate through the smart contract mechanism . In addition to the voting system which is an improvement over the current Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain consensus mechanisms, Tao also provides a new technique, Random Generals . This new technique significantly decreases the probability of having invalid blocks in the blockchain, dramatically reducing the overall attack surface. These enhancements and the components of Tao are step-by-step detailed in the followings.","title":"Tao architecture"},{"location":"wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/#Sec:StakeVoting","text":"","title":"Stakeholders &amp; Voting"},{"location":"wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/#coin-holders-masternodes","text":"Token holder is as simple as its name: users who join the network, who own and transfer TAO. Masternodes are full-nodes which maintain a copy of the blockchain, produce blocks and keep the chain consistent. It is worth noting that Tao is an extremely energy efficient cryptocurrency platform, as it does not use costly dedicated mining equiment as is required by Proof-of-Work-based blockchain systems. Only masternodes can produce and validate blocks, and in a mechanism known as Delegated Proof of Stake. Masternodes are selected via where token holders vote for block producers via an amount of TAO called a Delegate. The first requirement of being masternodes is to deposit 100,000TAO to the Voting Smart Contract. These depositors are listed as masternode candidates in the Voting DApp, which allows token holders to vote for them by sending a Delegate to the smart contract in the name of that masternode. Masternodes which process valid states to create and verify blocks will be incentivized with TAO. Furthermore, token holders who vote for these incentivized masternodes will also receive TAO in proportion to the amount of their Delegate. The list of masternode candidates is dynamically sorted based on Delegate counts. The performance of the masternodes will be tracked and reported back to the token holders in terms of three main metrics: CPU/Memory charts which ensure the workload of the masternodes, the number of signed blocks which indicates their work performance, and the last signed block which figures out their last activity. Token holders, at any time, can unvote masternodes, who have low performance, and provide their Delegates to the other masternodes which display superior performance. As lower performing masternodes lose Delegates, they will eventually denied the ability to create and sign new blocks. This mechanism keeps the system healthy and scalable as masternodes must always outperform their peers to maintain a superior production rate and thereby earn the most TAO. Therefore, only the strongest masternodes are voted and can flourish.","title":"Token holders, Masternodes"},{"location":"wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/#voting-masternode-pool","text":"There are maximum one hundred fifty (150) masternodes elected in the masternode pool.

The masternode, who takes turn in the circular and sequential order to create blocks, has to scan all of the created blocks in the epoch and count number of signatures. The reward mechanism is designed following the policy as follows: the higher number of signatures one masternode has made, the more reward he earns. For instance, within an epoch, masternode A who has sealed twice the blocks than masternode B earns double amount of TAO than masternode B does. Furthermore, there is also a reward sharing ratio among token holders and masternode who has been elected supported by the token holders. Specifically, each epoch consists of 900 blocks, which will reward a total of 250 TAO in the first two years. This amount of 250 TAO will be divided to all of the Masternodes proportionally to the number of signatures they sign during the epoch. Afterward, the reward achieved by each Masternode will be divided into three portions. - Infrastructure Reward : The first portion of 40% called Infrastructure Reward goes to the Masternode. Staking Reward : The second portion of 50% called Staking Reward goes to the pool of all voters for that Masternode which is shared proportionally based on the token stake. Foundation Reward : The last portion of 10% called Foundation Reward goes to a special account controlled by the Masternode Foundation, which is run by Tao company initially. It is worth noting that coin-holders who unvote before the checkpoint block will not receive any shared reward in the Staking Reward portion.","title":"Reward Mechanism"},{"location":"wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/#Sec:ProtocolOverview","text":"","title":"Tao Consensus Protocol"},{"location":"wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/#double-validation-process","text":"In Tao, masternodes share equal responsibility to run the system and keep it stable. Full nodes should run on powerful hardware configuration and high-speed network connectivity in order to ensure the required block time (target to two seconds). Only masternodes can produce and seal blocks. In order for that, the Tao consensus relies on the concept of Random Generals that improves some existing consensus mechanisms, namely Single Validation . In the followings, we first describe the Random Generals , then analyze the differences and improvements of Random Generals compared to Single Validation .","title":"Random Generals Process"},{"location":"wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/#random-generals-dv","text":"Similar to some existing PoS-based blockchains such as Cardano , each block is created by a block producer, namely masternode, that takes its block creation permission turn following a pre-determined and circular sequence of masternodes for each epoch. However, differently from these existing blockchains, DV in Tao requires the signatures of two masternodes on a block to be able to push the block to the blockchain. One of the masternodes is the block creator while the other one, namely block verifier is randomly selected among the set of voted masternodes that validates the block and signs it. In the followings, for more convenience, block creator and block verifier are used interchangeably for the masternode 1 (block producer) and the randomly selected masternode 2 for a block, respectively. The process of randomly selecting the block verifiers is detailed in the next paragraphs. Note that, there is no mining in the block creation as in Proof-of-Work-based blockchains (e.g. Ethereum and Bitcoin). It means that a created block is valid if and only if it is sealed by enough two signatures from a block creator and a corresponding block verifier to confirm the correctness of it. We believe this DV technique enhances the stability of the blockchain by diminishing the probability of producing \u201cgarbage\u201d blocks while still maintaining the system security and consistency. Randomization of block verifiers in DV is the key factor of reducing risks coming from paired masternodes trying to commit malicious blocks. Furthermore, comparing to some current public blockchains in the market, by utilizing the DV technique, Tao brings significant improvements in the block time by only requiring two signatures per block. For the purpose of showing our enhancement over existing PoS-based blockchains, we analyze the differences between DV and the Single Validation mechanism in some existing blockchains as follows.","title":"Random Generals (DV)"},{"location":"wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/#improvements-of-random-generals-over-single-validation","text":"Let\u2019s show the improvements of DV compared to Single Validation through analyzing some attacking scenarios as shown in Fig. Single Validation example and Fig. Random Generals example . Single Validation In Single Validation, in an epoch, each masternode, e.g. M1, sequentially takes its turn to create a block, e.g. block100. The next masternode, e.g. M2, in the sequence then validates the created block100. If block100 is invalid (that potentially means that M1 is an attacker) and contains a transaction that invalidly benefits M1, if M2 is honest (see Fig. SV a ), it rejects block100 and creates another block100 next to block99. But, if M2 is an attacker (see Fig. SV b ) that corporates with M1, M2 ignores the invalidation of block100, signs it and creates next block, namely block101 that is valid. Then, the next masternode M3 verifies that block101 is valid, M3 signs block101 and creates a block102. By this way, Single Validation potentially leaves the blockchain with \u201cgarbage\u201d or invalid blocks which require a \u201crebase\u201d to restore the validity of the blockchain. Single Validation (SV): (a) SV with block creation masternode as an attacker and (b) SV with two consecutive block creation masternodes as attackers Random Generals We claim that our DV technique significantly reduces the probability of having garbage blocks in the blockchain. Assuming that M1 and M2 are the block creator and block verifier, respectively, for block100 in our DV. If block100 is invalid and M2 is honest (see Fig. DV a ), M2 will not seal this block. Therefore, the next block creator M3 for creating block101 will see that block100 does not have enough 2 signatures, thus reject block100 and create another block100 next to block99. On the other hand, if M2 is also an attacker pairing/handshaking with M1 (see Fig. DV b ), M2 signs block100 despite its invalidity (remember that the block verifier M2 is randomly selected, there has little chance of successfully pairing M1 and M2). Next, even though M3 will verify that block100 has two valid signatures, M3 still rejects it because block100 is invalidated by M3 that will create another valid block100. In order to break the stability and consistency of the blockchain in this case, M3 should be an attacker together with M1 and M2, which, however, has a very low probability. In other words, DV strengthens the consistency of the blockchain and makes it hard to break.

In order to randomly generate the block verifiers for the next epoch e+1 , the process is performed by the following steps. Step 1: Random Numbers Generation and Commitment Phase: First, at the beginning of epoch e , each masternode V_i will securely create an array of n+1 special random numbers Recommend_i= [ r_{i.1}, r_{i.2}, ..., r_{i.n}, \\theta_i] , where r_{i.k}\\in [1, ..., m] indicating the recommendation of ordered list of block verifiers for the next epoch of V_i , and \\theta_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\} is used for increasing the unpredictability of the random numbers. Second, each masternode V_i has to encrypt the array Recommend_i using a secret key SK_i , say Secret_i = Encrypt (Recommend_i, SK_i) . Next, each masternode forms a \" lock \u201d message that contains encrypted secret array Secret_i ; signs off this message with its blockchain\u2019s private key through the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) scheme currently used in Ethereum and Bitcoin along with the corresponding epoch index and its public key generated from its private key. By doing this, every masternode can check who created this lock message through ECDSA verification scheme and which epoch it relates to. Then, each node V_i sends their lock message with its signature and public key to a Smart contract stored in the blockchain, so that eventually each masternode collects and knows the lock s from all other masternodes. Step 2: Discovery and Recovery Phase: The recovery phase is for every node to reveal its previous lock message so that other nodes can get to know the secret array it has sent before. A masternode only starts revealing its lock message if all masternodes have sent their lock messages to the smart contract or a certain timeout event occurs. Each masternode then opens its lock message by sending an \u201d unlock \u201d message to the smart contract for other masternodes to open the corresponding lock. Imagine a commitment-like scheme in this case where a lock message is a commitment message locking its contained recommendation array Recommend_i (so that no one can open or guess the contained array), and the unlock message gives the key for other masternodes to decrypt the box and retrieve the values of Recommend_i . Eventually, a masternode has both locks and unlocks of others. If some elector is an adversary which might publish its lock but not intend to send the corresponding unlock, other masternodes can ignore the adversary\u2019s lock and set all its random values be 1 as default. The idea is simple: the network can keep working successfully even if some masternodes are adversaries. Step 3: Assembled Matrix and Computation Phase: At the point of the slot n^{th} of the epoch e , the secret arrays Secret_I in the smart contract will be decrypted by each masternode and return the plain version of Recommend_i .

Only one block can be created in a slot. We assume that there is a roughly synchronized clock that allows for masternodes to learn the current slot. This simplification will effectively permit masternodes to execute the signing and validation process of the DPOS consensus, where each masternode must collectively create a block to the current slot. For more simplification, each slot sl_r is accessed by an integer r \\in \\{1, 2, ...900\\} , and suppose that the real time window that corresponds to each slot has the following properties, which are similar to what are specified in Cardano . Every masternode can determine the index of the current slot based on the current time and \u201dany discrepancies between parties\u2019 local time are insignificant in comparison with the length of time represented by a slot\u201d Cardano The amount of a slot time is sufficient to guarantee that any message transmitted by an honest party at the beginning of the time window will be received by any other honest party by the end of that time window. While this assumption similar to Cardano , Tao requires it in order for a block creator to propagate its created block to the corresponding block verifier to ensure that the block is signed by both the masternodes before the next block creator builds another block on top of it. As mentioned in Section TaoOverview , in our setting, we assume that the fixed collection of m (150) masternodes V_1, V_2, ...., V_m interact throughout the protocol. For each V_i a public/private key pair ( pk_i , sk_i ) for a prescribed signature scheme, ideally ECDSA, is generated. Furthermore, we assume that the public keys pk_1 ,.., pk_m of the masternodes are distributed and known by all of them (that means a masternode knows all public keys of other nodes). Some notable definitions of the blockchain concepts are defined following the notation in here . State A state (defined as in here ) is an encoded string st \\in \\{0,1\\}^\\lambda . Block A block (defined as in here ) B generated at a slot sl_i \\in \\{sl_1,...,sl_R\\} contains the current state st \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{\\lambda} , data d \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{*} , the slot number sl_i and a signature \\Sigma = Sign_{ski} (st, d, sl_i) computed under sk_i corresponding to the masternode V_i generating the block. Blockchain A blockchain (defined as in here ) C is a sequence of blocks B_1,..., B_n associated with a strictly increasing sequence of slots for which the state sti of B_i is equal to H(B_{i\u22121}) , where H is a collision-resistant cryptography hash function. A blockchain has a number of properties, including the length of a chain len(C) = n , which is its number of blocks, and the block B_n is the head of the chain, denoted head(C) . As mentioned earlier, in our Tao model, we set each time slot sl_i as 2 seconds; an epoch is a set R of 900 slots \\{ sl_1, sl_2, ..., sl_{900}\\} (an epoch time duration equals to 1800 seconds).

PoW-based miners require CapEx (capital expenditures) for buying mining equipment such as ASICs and OpEx (operation expenditures) such as electricity to solve mathematical puzzles securing the network (see here ). That means, there is always an intrinsic cost for miners in mining regardless of its success. In case of a fork, miners therefore always allocate their resource (equipment) to the chain that they believe is correct in order to get incentives for compensating the intrinsic costs in mining. In the contrary, in PoS-based systems without mining, during an ideal execution, for creating a fork only costs, masternodes actually do not incur intrinsic costs, other than roughly some block validation and signing cost. As a result, there\u2019s an inherent problem of the masternode having no downside to staking both forks. Therefore, there are actually two issues in the original design of PoS. On one hand, for any masternode, the optimal strategy is to validate every chain/fork, so that the masternode gets their rewards no matter which fork wins. On the other hand, for attackers/malicious masternodes, they can easily create a fork for double spending. Let\u2019s look back how Tao handles these two problems. As a reminder, Tao maintains a certain order of masternodes in creating and sealing blocks, in each epoch. For the first issue, random/arbitrary forks are hardly happened because the order of block creation masternodes is pre-determined for each epoch.

Bitcoin\u2019s core consensus protocol, often referred to as Nakamoto consensus Bitcoin , realizes a \u201creplicated state machine\u201d abstraction, where nodes in a permissionless network reach agreement about a set of transactions committed as well as their ordering (see here . However, known permissionless consensus protocols such as Bitcoin\u2019s Nakamoto consensus come at a cost. Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on PoW to roughly enforce the idea of \u201cone vote per hashpower\u201d and to defend against Sybil attacks. Unfortunately, PoW-based Bitcoin and Ethereum are known to have terrible performance (Bitcoin\u2019s transaction processing performance is at peak of around 7 transactions per second as previously mentioned). Moreover, PoW is much criticized because it costs a lot of electricity energy. In order to design an efficient and cost-effective consensus protocol in the permissionless model, PoS has been discussed extensively in the Bitcoin and Ethereum forum . A PoS blockchain can substitute the costly PoW in Nakamoto\u2019s blockchain while still providing similar guarantees in terms of transaction processing in the presence of a dishonest minority of users, where this \u201cminority\u201d is to be understood here in the context of stake rather than computational power Cardano . The Ethereum design Casper , published by Buterin & Griffith, provides as its initial version a PoW/PoS hybrid consensus protocol, which might eventually switch to a pure PoS system. As in Tao , Ethereum Casper requires that validators (term similar to block creators) have to deposit an amount. In fact, some concepts used in Tao such as checkpoint blocks are borrowed from Casper. Our (DPOS) consensus protocol proposed in this paper can be seen as a hybrid model. In particular, first, we apply with voting and Random Generals to create, verify and vote for blocks smoothly and efficiently. Whenever potentials of fork branches are detected, we employ the idea in PoW to select the longest branch with the most votes and discard the other branches. This hybrid approach not only increases the performance and security of blockchain, but also reduces the fork situation in an efficient and practical manner. Recently, there are several consensus protocol research works that are closely related to Tao such as EOS and Ouroboros of Cardano . The mechanism of voting for masternodes for reaching consensus is utilized by Bitshares and EOS , whose consensus protocol is termed Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). DPoS is similar to the Proof-of-Stake Voting consensus of Tao in the sense that masternodes (block creators or witnesses in DPoS) are elected through a voting system. However, Tao requires that masternodes need to deposit a required minimum amount of TAO to become a masternode candidate, which puts more pressure on the masternodes to work honestly. Furthermore, the Random Generals mechanism of Tao lowers the probability of handshaking attacks and having invalid blocks, as previously analyzed. EOS also has a maximum of 21 block producers for each epoch, which is less decentralized than Tao with a maximum of 150 masternodes elected (and this number of masternodes can be changed following the decentralized governance through voting). The research-backed Cardano blockchain solution, namely Ouroboros, with the ADA coin, which is purely based on Proof-of-Stake, promisingly claims to provide rigorous security guarantees. Similarly to Tao , Ouroboros has a set of block producers for each epoch for creating blocks and each block producer candidate needs to deposit a minimum amount of stake (an amount of ADA). However, note that, Ouroboros only provides Single Validation , while Random Generals of Tao provides several advantages over Single Validation, as previously analyzed. In Ouroboros, the order of block producers, selected among stakers, is based on a biased randomization while the Tao \u2019s randomization for block verifiers is potentially uniform and based on smart contracts. Furthermore, the use of voting as in Tao and DPoS enables a more incentive equality between stakers: In Ouroboros, stakers with very little stake have a very small probability of becoming block creators, while, in Tao , these stakers can choose an optimal strategy to vote for potential masternodes to get incentives.","title":"Related work"},{"location":"wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/#Sec:Conclusion","text":"In this paper, we proposed DPOS, a PoS Voting-based blockchain protocol with heuristic and fair voting mechanism, rigorous security guarantees, and fast finality.

Furthermore, in parallel with our novel consensus protocol, we will investigate the Sharding mechanism in order to provide even better transaction processing performance. We believe that, the Sharding technique with the stable number of masternodes will provide better stability and efficiency to the blockchain. At the same time, we commit to keep EVM-compatible smart contracts within our masternode sharding framework. Economic sustainability is also an important concept for a blockchain based decentralized network. That means to maintain the network in a sustainable condition, an equilibrium needs to be achieved, in which the cost of running the network infrastructure could be offset by the revenues generated. In this context, the cost of network infrastructure consists of two parts: the physical cost of having hardware such as servers, memories that passes the network technical requirements; and the capital cost of having TAO locked into smart-contracts. The revenues for Masternodes would primarily come from Reward Engine emission, and later on from service revenues such as token exchange fees provided by applications running on top of Tao. We will publish a Tao economic analysis and proposal, separate from this technical paper in a later date.","title":"Perspectives"},{"location":"wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/#Sec:References","text":"Satoshi Nakamoto.

Abstract \u00b6 The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard Application Programmable Interface (API) for tokens within Tao smart contracts. Tokens issued on Tao following this standard allows token holders to pay fee for transactions to the token contract in terms of the token itself. Motivation \u00b6 A standard token interface that extends TRC1 standard in order to allow holders of a token issued following this standard to make transactions without the need of holding TAO in the wallet for paying transaction fees. TRC2 Specification \u00b6 /** * @title TRC2 interface */ interface ITRC2 { function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256); function balanceOf(address who) external view returns (uint256); function estimateFee(uint256 value) external view returns (uint256); function issuer() external view returns (address); function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256); function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool); function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool); function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool); event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value); event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value); event Fee(address indexed from, address indexed to, address indexed issuer, uint256 value); } TRC2 API specification \u00b6 totalSupply : Returns the token total supply. function totalSupply () external view returns ( uint256 ); balanceOf : Returns the account balance of another account with address who . function balanceOf ( address who ) external view returns ( uint256 ); estimateFee : Estimate the transaction fee in terms of the token that the transaction makers will have to pay. Transaction fee will be paid to the issuer of the TRC2 token contract following our TaoZ protocol detailed in here . function estimateFee ( uint256 value ) external view returns ( uint256 ); Ideally the function will return the transaction fee based on the value (the number of tokens) that the transaction maker wants to transfer. Transaction fee for allowance function will be estimated if input parameter value = 0 . The way fees are computed is not standardized. Token issuers can fully customize the implementation of the function. This function will also be called by user wallets to evaluate fees the user must be paying. issuer : Returns the address of the token issuer. function issuer () external view returns ( address ); The method returns the address of the token issuer. The is to ensure that only the issuer has the right to apply to the TaoZ protocol for paying fees of token-holder transactions to the token contract in terms of the token itself. The method will be called by the TaoZ protocol source code to verify that no one else is able to apply the token to the TaoZ protocol, except the issuer. transfer : Transfers _value amount of tokens to address _to , and MUST fire the Transfer and Fee event. function transfer ( address _to , uint256 _value ) public returns ( bool success ) The function will call estimateFee function to compute the transaction fee. The function SHOULD throw if the message caller\u2019s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend and to pay transaction fees. Once succeeded, the token balance of the sender should be reduced by _value plus the computed transaction fee, the balance of _to should be increasing _value , while the balance of the token issuer should be increased by the computed transaction fee. approve function approve ( address spender , uint256 value ) external returns ( bool ); Allows _spender to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the _value amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with _value . This function also calls estimateFee with input parameter as 0 in order to compute the transaction fee in terms of tokens that the transaction sender must pay to the token issuer. allowance function allowance ( address owner , address spender ) external view returns ( uint256 ); Returns the amount which spender is still allowed to withdraw from owner . transferFrom function transferFrom ( address from , address to , uint256 value ) external returns ( bool ); Transfers value amount of tokens from address from to address to . The function must fire the Transfer and Fee event. TRC2 Event specification \u00b6 Transfer event Transfer ( address indexed from , address indexed to , uint256 value ); This event MUST be emitted when tokens are transferred in functions transfer and transferFrom . Approval event Approval ( address indexed owner , address indexed spender , uint256 value ); This event MUST be emitted on any successful call to approve function. Fee event Fee ( address indexed from , address indexed to , address indexed issuer , uint256 value ); This event MUST be emitted when tokens are transferred in functions transfer and transferFrom in order for clients/DApp/third-party wallets to notify its users about the paid transaction fee in terms of token. Implementation \u00b6 The following implements the basis of the standard. For any implementation of the TRC2 standard, the following contract fields must be defined at the beginning of the contract. mapping ( address => uint256 ) private _balances ; uint256 private _minFee ; address private _issuer ; This template allows the TaoZ protocol to consider the implemented token as TRC2 and any fees paid for transactions to the token contract will be based on the token, not TAO. _balances : record the balance of each token holder _minFee : the minimum fee in terms of tokens that the transaction sender must pay. Ideally minFee will be paid when approve function is called or when transaction fails. _issuer : the address of the token issuer who will receive transaction fees from token holders in terms of token, but will pay transaction fees to masternodes by means of TAO. This is detailed in our TaoZ protocol specification white paper . The implementation also defines some additional functions as follows: minFee : Returns the minimum fee for any transaction. issuer : Returns the address of the issuer of the token. /** * @title Standard TRC2 token * @dev Implementation of the basic standard token. */ contract TRC2 is ITRC2 { using SafeMath for uint256 ; mapping ( address => uint256 ) private _balances ; uint256 private _minFee ; address private _issuer ; mapping ( address => mapping ( address => uint256 )) private _allowed ; uint256 private _totalSupply ; /** * @dev Total number of tokens in existence */ function totalSupply () public view returns ( uint256 ) { return _totalSupply ; } /** * @dev The amount fee that will be lost when transferring. */ function minFee () public view returns ( uint256 ) { return _minFee ; } /** * @dev token's foundation */ function issuer () public view returns ( address ) { return _issuer ; } /** * @dev Gets the balance of the specified address. * @param owner The address to query the balance of. * @return An uint256 representing the amount owned by the passed address. */ function balanceOf ( address owner ) public view returns ( uint256 ) { return _balances [ owner ]; } /** * @dev Estimate transaction fee. * @param value */ function estimateFee ( uint256 value ) public view returns ( uint256 ) { return value . mul ( 0 ). add ( _minFee ); } /** * @dev Function to check the amount of tokens that an owner allowed to a spender. * @param owner address The address which owns the funds. * @param spender address The address which will spend the funds. * @return A uint256 specifying the amount of tokens still available for the spender. */ function allowance ( address owner , address spender ) public view returns ( uint256 ){ return _allowed [ owner ][ spender ]; } /** * @dev Transfer token for a specified address * @param to The address to transfer to. * @param value The amount to be transferred. */ function transfer ( address to , uint256 value ) public returns ( bool ) { uint256 total = value . add ( _minFee ); require ( to != address ( 0 )); require ( value <= total ); _transfer ( msg.sender , to , value ); _transfer ( msg.sender , _issuer , _minFee ); emit Fee ( msg.sender , to , _issuer , _minFee ); return true ; } /** * @dev Approve the passed address to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of msg.sender. * Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk that someone may use both the old * and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering.
