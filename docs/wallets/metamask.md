**Step 3:** You successfully connect to Tomochain Testnet after 2 steps. Next, you use TOMO to pay a Gas fee to implement Smart Contact. To have some TOMO in the testnet, you can enter your wallet address in Faucet site [https://faucet.testnet.tomochain.com/](https://faucet.testnet.tomochain.com/) to request some TOMO.

So, you accomplish connecting the MetaMask to Tomochain (testnet). From now on, you can make transactions and develop Dapp as well as Smart Contract as you wish.
