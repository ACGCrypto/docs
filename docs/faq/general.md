#### What is Tomocoin (TOMO)? How can I earn Tomocoin (TOMO)?
TomoCoin (TOMO) is the native cryptocurrency to TomoChain, and will be the reserve cryptocurrency for all third-party apps running on TomoChain. Being the protocol token for the TomoChain infrastructure, TOMO will be needed by all parties utilising TomoChain to build apps or issue and integrate cryptographic tokens into their apps.
 
The supply of TOMO is fixed, long-term and non-inflationary. In addition to above, TOMO is integral to the TomoChain network for a number of reasons: First, TOMO will be used to fund the development of TomoChain and TomoWallet; Second, TOMO will be used as a reward to incentivise the building of the Tomo engine/ecosystem; Third, TOMO will be used as a long-term, decentralized governance instrument of the Tomo network – the details of which will be announced in our upcoming technical white paper.

TOMO is currently available on a number of exchanges.

#### Is TOMO going to be swapped some day? If yes, how do I know I’ll be able to swap my tokens if I take them from an exchange? How will you switch from an ERC20 token to your own?
We will lock your tokens before swapping to mainnet, so there is no chance of losing the tokens. Whilst tokens are locked, they are not transferable to another address.
