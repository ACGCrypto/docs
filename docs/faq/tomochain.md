#### What is Tomochain? How does it work?
TomoChain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem of the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms. TomoChain relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support near-zero fees, and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes. 

TomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into TomoChain's Masternode architecture which will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses.

#### Is there a way to see the raw data that is stored in the blockchain?
Yes, there is. Token Sale information will be available for viewing on ethplorer or etherscan.

#### How can I check out the TomoChain infrastructure?
The TomoChain testnet 2.0 is available at [https://medium.com/tomochain/tomochain-public-testnet-2-0-announcement-c7f49e28eefa](https://medium.com/tomochain/tomochain-public-testnet-2-0-announcement-c7f49e28eefa)

#### What is the difference between POA network and TomoChain? Where is the advantage?
At the moment, TomoChain uses PoA consensus like POA Network does. However, POA uses code base of Parity, whereas Tomochain uses the code base of Ethereum. Secondly, in the end of 2018, Tomochain will move from PoA consensus to PoSV masternodes.
Thirdly, regarding confirmation time, with Tomochain technology, one block will be created every 2s while a POA network block requires 5s. Finally, the Tomochain testnet 2.0 can handle over 2000 .

---

#### What exactly is the node of Tomochain?
Initially, regarding PoA consensus, nodes can be chosen by the built-in governance D-app but they will need to pass the technical requirements for scaling of the network.

At the second stage, Master-nodes can be chosen by the network in a trust-less way as long as they hold a sufficient amount of stake and pass the proof of credibility protocol in the governance d-app.

#### Why don't you publish all the codes on Github?
Private development is done in GitLab which is free and more convenient. The code for cross-chain transfer protocol updates to Geth codebases. Only ReplyBlock is privately developed on Gitlab. However this software is actually running on the testnet, and under production (ReplyBlock) already.

Tomochain products, such as the Tomo Governance DApp, Block Explorer publish the source code on: https://github.com/tomochain. We released ICO smart-contract codes, container codes for building nodes and joint testnet, slides for tomochain roadmap, cross chain transfer demo codes. It should be clear that we are having private repos, and publish codes publicly when they are ready, or need to be audited.

We chose a model our team are comfortable with. Publishing work-in-progress is not suitable for us at the moment for multiple reasons - including inviting unnecessary distractions, and designing needs a to be done before coding. Protecting and auditing important codes is also more responsible, until the team reaches a certain scale.

We are also working with some third parties with which we signed non-disclosure-agreements for code development.

---

#### Is Tomochain a side chain of Ethereum?
No, it isn't. Tomochain will have its own blockchain when mainnet is launched in Q4 2018.

---

#### What is the difference between Tomocoin and Tomochain?

Tomocoin (TOMO) is the native token of the Tomochain infrustructure.

#### What is required to become a Tomochain masternode?
You need to deposit 50k TOMO to become a masternode candidate. Candidates become masternodes if they belong to the top 150 most votedtps candidates. 
 
---

#### What are Candidate/ Masternode incentives?

Masternodes will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which likely exceeds the cost for running the infrastructure. However, masternodes need to invest in TomoChain by depositing  at least 50K Tomo, and stake them for a long term. Furthermore, after depositing 50K Tomo to become a candidate, if the account does not become a masternode (has less votes than Top  150 most voted  Candidates), he/she will receive no rewards. Therefore, candidates are incentivised to do as much as they can to signal their capability to support TomoChain to get into top 150 most voted Candidates.

---

#### What are Token Voter incentives? Do voters get reward from node holders too?

Token voters should vote for candidates who signal strong support for TomoChain - as candidates that do not become masternodes will receive no rewards, and hence voters will also not be rewarded. However, token voters should also consider voting for candidates with lower number of votes, as the most voted candidates will have to share rewards with a larger number of voters.

---

#### How will reward be divided? 

The rewards achieved by each masternode will be divided into three portions. The first portion of 40% called “Infrastructure Reward” goes to the masternode. The second portion of 50% called “Staking Reward” goes to the pool of voters for that masternode and is shared proportionally based on the number of tokens staked. The last portion of 10% called “Foundation Reward” goes to a special account controlled by the Masternode Foundation, which will initially be run by the TomoChain company.
