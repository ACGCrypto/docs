#### What is Tomochain? How does it work?
TomoChain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem of the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms. TomoChain relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support near-zero fees, and 2-second transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes. 

TomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into TomoChain's Masternode architecture which will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses.

#### Is there a way to see the raw data that is stored in the blockchain?
Yes, there is. Token Sale information will be available for viewing on ethplorer or etherscan.

#### How can I check out the TomoChain infrastructure?
You can read our detailed announcement about our Testnet 2.0 at [https://medium.com/tomochain/tomochain-public-testnet-2-0-announcement-c7f49e28eefa](https://medium.com/tomochain/tomochain-public-testnet-2-0-announcement-c7f49e28eefa).

#### What is the difference between POA network and TomoChain? Where is the advantage?
At the moment, TomoChain uses PoA consensus like POA Network does. However, POA uses code base of Parity, whereas Tomochain uses the code base of Ethereum. Secondly, in the end of 2018, Tomochain will move from PoA consensus to PoSV masternodes.
Thirdly, regarding confirmation time, with Tomochain technology, one block will be created every 2s while a POA network block requires 5s. Finally, the Tomochain testnet 2.0 can handle over 2000 .

---

#### What exactly is the node of Tomochain?
Initially, regarding PoA consensus, nodes can be chosen by the built-in governance D-app but they will need to pass the technical requirements for scaling of the network.

At the second stage, Master-nodes can be chosen by the network in a trust-less way as long as they hold a sufficient amount of stake and pass the proof of credibility protocol in the governance d-app.

---

#### Why don't you publish all the codes on Github?

All the code regarding TomoChain is free to consult on our [GitHub](https://github.com/tomochain).
This includes the code for TomoChain's blockchain, governance DApp, block explorer, tools, docker images, documentation, etc.

However, other blockchain related projects like ReplyBlock or drafts, work in progress and not yet disclosed projects are usually kept in private repositories.

We like to publish code publicly when it reaches a certain level of development and/or when we think auditing and contributions are beneficial to the codebase.
Keeping early projects private is probably more responsible for now due to our scale.
It might change in the future.

We are also working with some third parties with which we signed a non-disclosure-agreements for code development.

---

#### Is Tomochain a side chain of Ethereum?
No, it isn't. TomoChain will have its own blockchain when our mainnet is launched in Q4 2018.

---

#### What is the difference between Tomocoin and Tomochain?
TomoCoin (TOMO) is the native token of the TomoChain ecosystem.

#### What is required to become a Tomochain masternode?
You need to deposit 50k TOMO to become a masternode candidate. Candidates become masternodes if they belong to the top 150 most voted candidates. 
 
---

#### What are Candidate/ Masternode incentives?

Masternodes will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which likely exceeds the cost for running the infrastructure. However, masternodes need to invest in TomoChain by depositing  at least 50K Tomo, and stake them for a long term. Furthermore, after depositing 50K Tomo to become a candidate, if the account does not become a masternode (has less votes than Top  150 most voted  Candidates), he/she will receive no rewards. Therefore, candidates are incentivised to do as much as they can to signal their capability to support TomoChain to get into top 150 most voted Candidates.

---

#### What are Token Voter incentives? Do voters get reward from node holders too?

Token voters should vote for candidates who signal strong support for TomoChain - as candidates that do not become masternodes will receive no rewards, and hence voters will also not be rewarded.
However, token voters should also consider voting for candidates with lower number of votes, as the reward is split proportionally between all the stackers on a same masternode.

---

#### How will reward be divided? 

The rewards achieved by each masternode will be divided into three portions. The first portion of 40% called “Infrastructure Reward” goes to the masternode. The second portion of 50% called “Staking Reward” goes to the pool of voters for that masternode and is shared proportionally based on the number of tokens staked. The last portion of 10% called “Foundation Reward” goes to a special account controlled by the Masternode Foundation, which will initially be run by the TomoChain company.
