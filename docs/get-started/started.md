# Voter's Guide

This page will introduce you to masternode voting in the Tomochain ecosystem.

## Create a wallet

In order to vote, you first need to create a wallet in our testnet.

You can create it really easily with Myetherwallet or Metamask. The url of our testnet is `https://testnet.tomochain.com`

You can follow [this tutorial](https://medium.com/tomochain/tomo-guideline-how-to-connect-metamask-wallet-to-tomochain-f25053361ef) for Metamask.

## Get some TOMO

We have a service called "Faucet" who allows you to get TOMO fifteen at a time.
You can access it at this address: [https://faucet.testnet.tomochain.com](https://faucet.testnet.tomochain.com)

Enter your wallet address in the field and tick the `I'm not a robot` box.

Finally, click `REQUEST 15 TOMO`. Wait for some second for the transaction to be confirmed.

You will receive a success confirmation message and the amount of TOMO in your wallet should be updated.

## How To Vote

Now that you have some TOMO. You can access our governance dapp, [Tomomaster](https://master.testnet.tomochain.com/), to start voting for masternodes.


Tomomaster natively supports Metamask. You can also access your account page (the vertical three dots on the top right) to fill in your wallet Private Key or MNEMONIC (see image below).
