This page will provide users with an overview of TomoChain's product map and 
how to read the documentation site, depending on readers' interest.

The backbone of TomoChain's products and ecosystem is the TomoChain blockchain 
with its innovative Proof-of-Staking Voting (PoSV) consensus.
To facilitate interactions between users (including voters and masternode owners) 
and the TomoChain blockchain, 
a set of products have been built, including TomoScan, TomoMaster, TomoWallet, 
and our stats page.
TomoChain has been also developing a decentralized exchange protocol with 
its relayer-based architecture.
These products will be continuously improved in our long-term plan.
Furthermore, more highly innovative products and technologies will be intensively
developed and researched to make TomoChain become an ideal platform for blockchain 
games, open finance, and enterprise-oriented applications.   

# Overview of TomoChain's products

![overview](/assets/overview.png)

* **TomoChain**: TomoChain is the backbone public blockchain of TomoChain's product map.

* **TomoScan**: TomoScan provides a user friendly, 
details and perfection-oriented user interface for TomoChain block explorer. 
From a user perspective, TomoScan brings TomoChainâ€™s transparency to users, 
because all block, transaction, finality, smart contracts, 
dApp and token information are read from TomoChain and shown to users. 
Furthermore, TomoScan also offers technical visualisations and does 
useful statistics about the TomoChain performance, token holders and 
other functionalities.

* **TomoMaster**: The `Governance dApp` - TomoMaster, provides a professional 
UI that allows to see the list of masternodes and candidates, 
to deposit 50k TOMO to become a masternode candidate, to vote for masternodes, 
and to show masternode performance statistics.

* **TomoWallet**: Tomo Wallet is the official mobile wallet for TomoChain, 
aiming to store the TOMO native coin and tokens issued on TomoChain. 
Tomo Wallet also allows users to vote for masternodes and track rewards.

* **TomoX**: TomoX is a decentralize d cryptocurrency exchange directly 
integrated into the core layer of the TomoChain blockchain. 
Decentralized exchanges called relayers built following the TomoX 
standard will all interact with TomoX.

# How to read this documentation site
The documentation site is designed to facilitate readers 
in understand what are written on the site.

* For voters: Voters who mainly vote for masternodes to receive rewards are 
encouraged to our tutorials on [how to connect wallets to TomoChain](/get-started/wallet) and [how to vote](/get-started/voting/).

* For masternode owners: A masternode is an important entity in TomoChain's ecosystem.
A TomoChain masternode is a server which uses its computing power to 
contribute to the network. Its job is to create and sign blocks. 
For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in 
the form of TOMO.
A masternode must satisfy a [minimum requirements](/masternode/requirements/) about 
its computing power, RAM, and storage
in order to stably maintain the network.
A financial requirement of 50k TOMO is also needed to [apply](/masternode/applying/) 
to become a masternode candidate.
For this, masternode owners are highly recommended to carefully read our dedicated guide
to running a masternode, 
using [tmn](/masternode/tmn/) and [Docker](/masternode/docker/).
Also, masternode owners can follow our [tutorial](https://medium.com/tomochain/how-to-run-a-tomochain-masternode-from-a-to-z-3793752dc3d1) on TomoChain medium page.

* For developers: We highly encourage developers to contribute to the development of 
TomoChain ecosystem growth.
For this reason, we have been building a set of developer tutorials and documentation 
to develop DApps run on TomoChain as well as to contribute to the development
of TomoChain's products.
This [DApp tutorial](/advance/dappdeploytuto/) shows how to deploy a smart contract 
on TomoChain.
For developers who are curious about TomoChain's source code, this 
[private TomoChain testnet](/advance/tutoprivatenet/) guides you how to setup 
a private TomoChain testnet.
