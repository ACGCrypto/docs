# How to read this documentation site
The documentation site is designed to facilitate readers 
in understanding what are written on the site.

* For voters: Voters who mainly vote for masternodes to receive rewards are 
encouraged to our tutorials on [how to connect wallets to Tao](/get-started/wallet) and [how to vote](/get-started/voting/).

* For masternode owners: A masternode is an important entity in Tao's ecosystem.
A Tao masternode is a server which uses its computing power to 
contribute to the network. Its job is to create and sign blocks. 
For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in 
the form of TAO.
A masternode must satisfy a [minimum requirements](/masternode/masternode-setup-guide/#technical-requirements-recommendations) about 
its computing power, RAM, and storage
in order to stably maintain the network.
A financial requirement of 50k TAO is also needed to [apply](/masternode/masternode-setup-guide/#11-apply-for-masternode-candidacy) 
to become a masternode candidate.
For this, masternode owners are highly recommended to carefully read our dedicated guide
to [running a masternode](/masternode/masternode-setup-guide), 
using [taomn](/masternode/masternode-setup-guide/#6-installing-taomn-utility) and [Docker](/masternode/masternode-setup-guide/#5-setup-docker-logged-in-as-new-user).
Also, masternode owners can follow our [tutorial](https://medium.com/taoblockchain/how-to-run-a-tao-masternode-from-a-to-z-3793752dc3d1) on Tao medium page 
and our [wiki page](https://github.com/taoblockchain/docs/wiki).


* For developers: We highly encourage developers to contribute to the development of 
Tao ecosystem growth.
For this reason, we have been building a set of developer tutorials and documentation 
on developing DApps to be run on Tao as well as to contribute to the development
of Tao's products.
This [DApp tutorial](/advance/dappdeploytuto/) shows how to deploy a smart contract 
on Tao.
For developers who are curious about Tao's source code, this 
[private Tao testnet](/advance/tutoprivatenet/) guides you how to setup 
a private Tao testnet.
