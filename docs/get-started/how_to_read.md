# How to read this documentation site
The documentation site is designed to facilitate readers 
in understand what are written on the site.

* For voters: Voters who mainly vote for masternodes to receive rewards are 
encouraged to our tutorials on [how to connect wallets to TomoChain](/get-started/wallet) and [how to vote](/get-started/voting/).

* For masternode owners: A masternode is an important entity in TomoChain's ecosystem.
A TomoChain masternode is a server which uses its computing power to 
contribute to the network. Its job is to create and sign blocks. 
For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in 
the form of TOMO.
A masternode must satisfy a [minimum requirements](/masternode/requirements/) about 
its computing power, RAM, and storage
in order to stably maintain the network.
A financial requirement of 50k TOMO is also needed to [apply](/masternode/applying/) 
to become a masternode candidate.
For this, masternode owners are highly recommended to carefully read our dedicated guide
to running a masternode, 
using [tmn](/masternode/tmn/) and [Docker](/masternode/docker/).
Also, masternode owners can follow our [tutorial](https://medium.com/tomochain/how-to-run-a-tomochain-masternode-from-a-to-z-3793752dc3d1) on TomoChain medium page.

* For developers: We highly encourage developers to contribute to the development of 
TomoChain ecosystem growth.
For this reason, we have been building a set of developer tutorials and documentation 
to develop DApps run on TomoChain as well as to contribute to the development
of TomoChain's products.
This [DApp tutorial](/advance/dappdeploytuto/) shows how to deploy a smart contract 
on TomoChain.
For developers who are curious about TomoChain's source code, this 
[private TomoChain testnet](/advance/tutoprivatenet/) guides you how to setup 
a private TomoChain testnet.
