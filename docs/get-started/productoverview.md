# Overview of TomoChain's products

The backbone of TomoChain's products and ecosystem is the TomoChain blockchain 
with its innovative Proof-of-Staking Voting (PoSV) consensus.
To facilitate interactions between users (including voters and masternode owners) 
and the TomoChain blockchain, 
a set of products have been built, including TomoScan, TomoMaster, TomoWallet, 
and our stats page.
TomoChain has been also developing a decentralized exchange protocol with 
its relayer-based architecture.
These products will be continuously improved in our long-term plan.
Furthermore, more highly innovative products and technologies will be intensively
developed and researched to make TomoChain become an ideal platform for blockchain 
games, open finance, and enterprise-oriented applications.   

* **TomoChain**: TomoChain is the backbone public blockchain of TomoChain's product map.

* **TomoScan**: TomoScan provides a user friendly, 
details and perfection-oriented user interface for TomoChain block explorer. 
From a user perspective, TomoScan brings TomoChainâ€™s transparency to users, 
because all block, transaction, finality, smart contracts, 
dApp and token information are read from TomoChain and shown to users. 
Furthermore, TomoScan also offers technical visualisations and does 
useful statistics about the TomoChain performance, token holders and 
other functionalities.

* **TomoMaster**: The `Governance dApp` - TomoMaster, provides a professional 
UI that allows to see the list of masternodes and candidates, 
to deposit 50k TOMO to become a masternode candidate, to vote for masternodes, 
and to show masternode performance statistics.

* **TomoWallet**: Tomo Wallet is the official mobile wallet for TomoChain, 
aiming to store the TOMO native coin and tokens issued on TomoChain. 
Tomo Wallet also allows users to vote for masternodes and track rewards.

* **TomoX**: TomoX is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange directly 
integrated into the core layer of the TomoChain blockchain. 
Decentralized exchanges called relayers built following the TomoX 
standard will all interact with TomoX.

* **TomoZ**: is a TomoChain on-chain protocol that allows any token holders to transfer tokens without holding TOMO in their wallet. The transaction fees will be paid in the token the user is holding.

* **TomoIssuer**: provides a friendly UI and a smart contract that allow any user to issue a TRC21 token and apply the token to the TomoZ protocol in minutes without any programming skills required.
