This is a procedural step-by-step guide to setting up your first Tomochain Masternode.
It is meant for beginners and first-timers, but some pre-requisites are assumed: That you can setup your own cloud-hosted server (VPS), and that you have a basic knowledge of how to ssh-into and operate the linux command-line.

Disclaimer: Do not proceed with this guide if you do not have the requisite Linux familiarity. The upkeep and troubleshooting will become more complex than this guide.
