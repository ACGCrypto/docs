Below are the most important features of TaoIssuer that have made it a revolutionary tool:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Issue a TRC21 token in only a few steps.
- **No Coding Experience Required:** No prerequisite knowledge about smart contract programming is needed.
- **Token Customization Options:** Customize the token supply, token name, and minimum transaction fee through TaoIssuer’s dashboard.


### Issue token
At the homepage you will see two main options with the TaoIssuer. The first one is to create the new TRC21 token and the second one is donate fee for an existing TRC21 token.

Go to Token Issuance dashboard, then sets of the parameters (From top to bottom: Token’s Name; Token’s Symbol; Token’s Total Supply, and Token’s Decimals). A small number of issuance fee will be charged, make sure that your wallet has enough testnet TAO. You can get free testnet TAO from our [faucet](https://faucet.testnet.tao.network).

**Disclaimer**: The token issuance fee is not fixed, the fee is adjusted by RPC owner who runs the full-node

TaoIssuer will ask you the token’s information to confirm. Please check all the criteria carefully before clicking on the “Issue token” and wait for the contract to be deployed.

**Note:** Any developer with some experience of developing and deploying smart contracts can refer to our reference implementation of the TRC21 standard to make customizations to the deployed token contract.

### Apply TaoZ protocol
You will receive a notification when your token is successfully issued, click “view detail” to check the token’s summary including: number of holders, transactions, etc. Choose “Apply to pay fee by any token” for TaoZ integration.

Once deployed, the issuer needs to claim to the network that the fees for all transactions to the newly deployed token contract will be paid in terms of the issued token. If you agree with the condition then move to the next step by entering “I understand”

Token issuer need to deposit a minimum amount of 10TAO to apply TaoZ protocol. The deposit can’t be withdrawn, that amount is deducted to pay masternodes for transaction processing.

Congratulations! You have already applied your TRC21 token to TaoZ protocol. Now you can edit the transaction fee (transaction fee in your token). You can change this number during the operation of your token.

In the token management dashboard, you will have some buttons to interact with the tokens such as transfer, deposit more TAO to pay for subsequent transaction fees. Don’t forget to check your TRC21 fee fund because transactions will not be processed if the remaining deposit is not enough to pay transaction fees.

### Donate transaction fee
If the TAO funds of the token issuer in TaoIssuer is not enough to pay for subsequent transaction fees, any token holders can deposit more TAO to the TaoIssuer contract to continue making transactions.

Go to donate transaction fee tab from TaoIssuer’s homepage. Enter the name of token you want to donate fee then input the donation amount. Considering that transaction fee in Tao is near-zero, 1 TAO can power thousands of transactions.

### Transfer token
You can transfer your TRC21 token to any member in your community just by going to “transfers token”. TaoWallet (testnet version) will start running in a new tab so you can use it to transfer issued token.
