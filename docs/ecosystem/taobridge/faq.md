### Is Tao migrating to Binance Chain?

No we are not. We are simply offering a 2-way bridge to allow Tao holders to operate on Binance Chain (Tao <-> Binance Chain). This is Taoâ€™s first real test of cross-chain compatibility using TaoBridge.

### What is TAOB?

Tao has issued BEP-2 TAO tokens on Binance Chain called TAOB. With the creation of TAOB, we have locked up an equal number of native TAO to ensure the total supply remains the same.

### Can I trade TAOB on Binance DEX now after swapping?

Yes, you can.

### How do I swap my TAO to TAOB and vice versa?

Go to [TaoBridge](https://bridge.tao.network) and swap between TAO and TAOB. Check out this video for details: [TaoBridge Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TglV_VyAYI4&feature=youtu.be)

### Can TaoB be staked?

No you can't stake TaoB.
