# Frequently asked questions

## TomoCoin

!!! quote "What are TomoCoins? How can I earn them?"
    TomoCoin (TOMO) is the native cryptocurrency of TomoChain and will be the reserve cryptocurrency for all third-party apps running on TomoChain.
    Being the protocol token for the TomoChain infrastructure, TOMO will be needed by all parties utilising TomoChain to build apps or issue and integrate cryptographic tokens into their apps.

    The supply of TomoCoin is fixed, long-term and non-inflationary.

    In addition to the above, TomoCoin is an integral part of the TomoChain network for a number of reasons.

    - Tomocoin will be used to fund the development of TomoChain and it's ecosystem (TomoScan, TomoMater, TomoWallet, etc.).
    - Tomocoin will be used as a reward to incentivise the building of the TomoChain engine/ecosystem.
    - Tomocoin will be used as a long-term, decentralized governance instrument of the TomoChain network.

    You can check our [technical whitepaper](/wp-and-research/technical-whitepaper/) for more details.

## Ecosystem

### TomoChain

!!! quote "What is Tomochain? How does it work?"
    TomoChain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem of the Ethereum blockchain, and other current blockchain platforms.
    TomoChain relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus that can support near-zero fees and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
    Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes.

    TomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers.
    New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into TomoChain's Masternode architecture.
    It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses.

!!! quote "Is TomoChain a side chain of Ethereum?"
    No.
    TomoChain will have its own blockchain when our Mainnet is launched in Q4 2018.

!!! quote "What is the difference between TomoCoin and TomoChain?"
    TomoCoin (TOMO) is the native currency of the TomoChain ecosystem.

### Blockchain

!!! quote "Is there a way to see the raw data stored in the TomoChain blockchain?"
    Yes.
    You can use our block explorer, [TomoScan](https://scan.testnet.tomochain.com).
    It's pretty similar to etherscan if you are already familliar with it.

!!! quote "Where can I check the actual products/ecosystem?"
    For now, you can consult the Testnet as our Mainnet will launch in Q4 2018.
    Please read the complete Testnet announcement on our [Medium post](https://medium.com/tomochain/tomochain-public-testnet-2-0-announcement-c7f49e28eefa).

    If you want to access it directly, you can find the links to our different products deployed in Testnet on our [Netwoks](/general/networks/) page.

!!! quote "What is a masternode in the TomoChain ecosystem?"
    A TomoChain masternode is a server who will use it's computing power to contribute to the network.
    It's job will be to create and signe blocks.

    Masternodes are elected using the PoSV consensus via our governance dApp [TomoMaster](https://master.testnet.tomochain.com)

!!! quote "What is required to become a TomoChain masternode?"
    You need to deposit 50'000 TOMO to become a masternode candidate.
    Candidates become masternodes if they belong to the top 150 most voted candidates.

!!! quote "What are the incentives to become a candidate or masternode?"
    Masternodes will receive a significant amount of block rewards, which will likely exceeds the cost for running the infrastructure.
    However, masternode owners need to invest in TomoChain by depositing  at least 50'000 TOMO, and stake them in the long term.

    After the initial deposite, if the account does not become a masternode (has less votes than the top 150 most voted candidates), he will not receive rewards.
    Therefore, candidates are incentivised to do as much as they can to signal their capability to support TomoChain to get into top 150 most voted candidates.

!!! quote "What are the voters incentives? Do voters get rewards too?"
    Token voters should vote for the candidates who demonstrate strong support to the TomoChain ecosystem.
    If strong candidates are voted to masternode, the network will be more powerfull and the voters will earn more rewards.

    More informations on the voting and reward mechanism in the [economical whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/197Cu57A6OYPoEQbrUVr067qNVEzP_FEwaDCFff7hnlM).

## Company

!!! quote "Where is your company registered?"
    You can check our informations on the [Singaporean registry](https://www.sgpbusiness.com/company/Tomochain-Pte-Ltd).

    You can also but the ACRA copy if you need more details

!!! quote "How many people are in the TomoChain team?"
    We are around twenty-five people working fulltime.
    We constantly adapt our hiring process depending on the new projects we get.

    Check us out on our [main website](https://tomochain.com/about-us/)!

!!! quote "Where can I take a look at the code?"
    All the code regarding TomoChain is free to consult on our [GitHub](https://github.com/tomochain).
    This includes the code for the TomoChain blockchain client, governance DApp, block explorer, tools, docker images, documentation, etc.

    However, other blockchain related projects like ReplyBlock or drafts, work in progress and not yet disclosed projects are usually kept in private repositories.

    We like to publish code publicly when it reaches a certain level of development and/or when we think auditing and contributions are beneficial to the codebase.
    Keeping early projects private is probably more responsible for now due to our scale.
    It might change in the future.

    We are also working with some third parties with which we signed a non-disclosure-agreements for code development.

!!! quote "Where can I contact you to get support?"
    If you need support, please contact us on one of this platform.
