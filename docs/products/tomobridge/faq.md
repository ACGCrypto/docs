### Is TomoChain migrating to Binance Chain?

No we are not. We are simply offering a 2-way bridge to allow TomoChain holders to operate on Binance Chain (TomoChain <-> Binance Chain). This is TomoChainâ€™s first real test of cross-chain compatibility using TomoBridge.

### What is TOMOB?

TomoChain has issued BEP-2 TOMO tokens on Binance Chain called TOMOB. With the creation of TOMOB, we have locked up an equal number of native TOMO to ensure the total supply remains the same.

### Can I trade TOMOB on Binance DEX now after swapping?

Yes, you can.

### How do I swap my TOMO to TOMOB and vice versa?

Go to [TomoBridge](https://bridge.tomochain.com) and swap between TOMO and TOMOB. Check out this video for details: [TomoBridge Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TglV_VyAYI4&feature=youtu.be)

### Can TomoB be staked?
